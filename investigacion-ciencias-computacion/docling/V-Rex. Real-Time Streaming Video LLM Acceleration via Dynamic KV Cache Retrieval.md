Abstract -Streaming video large language models (LLMs) are increasingly
used for real-time multimodal tasks such as video captioning, question
answering, conversational agents, and augmented reality. However, these
models face fundamental memory and computational challenges because
their key-value (KV) caches grow substantially with continuous streaming
video input. This process requires an iterative prefill stage, which is
a unique feature of streaming video LLMs. Prior works reduce excessive
cache overhead by utilizing the KV cache retrieval algorithm, which
offloads the full KV cache to CPU memory or storage, then selectively
fetches the most relevant entries. Nevertheless, due to its iterative
prefill stage, they suffer from significant limitations, including
extensive computation, substantial data transfer, and degradation in
accuracy. Crucially, this issue is exacerbated for edge deployment,
which is the primary target for these models. The memory footprint
exceeds the memory capacity within minutes of video streams, making low-
latency, energy-efficient inference infeasible.

In this work, we propose V-Rex, the first software-hardware co-designed
accelerator that comprehensively addresses both algorithmic and hardware
bottlenecks in streaming video LLM inference. At its core, V-Rex
introduces ReSV, a training-free dynamic KV cache retrieval algorithm.
ReSV exploits temporal and spatial similarity-based token clustering to
reduce excessive KV cache memory across video frames, and dynamically
adjusts token selection per transformer layer and attention head to
minimize the number of selected tokens. To fully realize these
algorithmic benefits, V-Rex offers a compact, low-latency hardware
accelerator with a dynamic KV cache retrieval engine (DRE), featuring
bit-level and early-exit based computing units, as well as hierarchical
KV cache memory management. Evaluated on COIN benchmarks, V-Rex achieves
unprecedented real-time of 3.9-8.3 FPS and energy-efficient streaming
video LLM inference on edge deployment with negligible accuracy loss.
While DRE only accounts for 2.2% power and 2.0% area, the system
delivers 1.9-19.7 × speedup and 3.1-18.5 × energy efficiency
improvements over AGX Orin GPU. This work is the first to
comprehensively tackle KV cache retrieval across algorithm and hardware,
enabling real-time streaming video LLM inference on resource-constrained
edge devices, with clear potential for scalable deployment in large-
scale server environments.

## I. INTRODUCTION

Recently, the demand for artificial intelligence that can understand and
interpret various modalities (i.e., text, image, video, and speech) and
respond to inquiries has been a driving force in machine learning
research. As a result, large multimodal models (LMM) [42] have emerged
as promising solutions in various AI industries. Notably, streaming
video large language models (LLMs) have gained significant attention for
their ability to jointly comprehend the video and text modalities in
real-time. Streaming video LLMs demonstrate a wide range of tasks,
including video captioning, question answering, conversational agents,
and augmented reality. [4], [32], [38]. Unlike offline video LLMs [29],
[33], [45], it processes real-time video streams and responds to users'
inquiries, which primarily runs on edge devices. Due to continuous video
input requiring an iterative process of video frames, computation and
memory usage scale substantially. It causes the key-value (KV) caches to
rapidly exceed the GPU memory capacity, and processing long video
streams in realtime becomes impractical.

Existing KV cache optimizations are fundamentally mismatched for
streaming and interactive workloads. Destructive methods, such as
pruning [37], compression [12], [19], [36], and quantization [13], [17],
[21], [34] risk permanently discarding information that, while
irrelevant to the current query, may be essential for future ones,
disrupting conversational continuity. A more promising approach, KV
cache retrieval [6], [16], [24], avoids this issue by offloading the
full cache to CPU memory or storage and fetching only relevant tokens,
thereby reducing GPU memory usage while maintaining coherent responses
for more extended input sequences. Although effective in reducing memory
usage, they rely on bandwidth-limited links such as PCIe (4-32 GB/s),
which are far slower than GPU memory bandwidth (1-2 TB/s). Thus,
selective retrieval is necessary to avoid severe data transfer.

However, current retrieval algorithms, designed for the text generation
stage, perform poorly under the iterative prefill stage of streaming
video. Moreover, their reliance on fixed top-k selection, which is a
computationally regular and GPUfriendly primitive, introduces
algorithmic inefficiencies. This static strategy ignores the highly
variable importance of tokens across transformer layers and attention
heads [7], [36], [41]. Enforcing a fixed-k policy prioritizes hardware
convenience over the algorithm's need, leading to systemic
inefficiencies: either over-fetching redundant tokens, wasting PCIe
bandwidth and energy, or under-fetching critical ones, degrading
accuracy. Addressing this challenge requires more than an algorithmic
tweak. It demands a new hardware optimization.

We present V-Rex, the first streaming video LLM accelerator designed to
address the large memory and computational requirements of the KV cache.
It embodies this softwarehardware co-design principle through the
tightly integrated innovations, as shown in Figure 1. At the software
level, we propose ReSV a training-free KV cache retrieval algorithm that
intelligently perceives and exploits the unique characteristics of video
data. It significantly reduces the number of fetched tokens for the
iterative prefill stage. ReSV's hash-bit key clustering provides a
computationally lightweight mechanism to identify and group tokens with
high spatial-temporal similarity, drastically reducing redundancy
without expensive computation. Building on this, its weighted cumulative
sum (WiCSum) thresholding acts as an adaptive mechanism, dynamically
selecting the most critical tokens on a fine-grained, layer-wise, and
head-wise basis, moving far beyond the rigid constraints of fixed top-k.
At the hardware level, we introduce the dynamic KV cache retrieval
engine (DRE), a compact accelerator that serves as the essential enabler
for ReSV. The KV cache prediction unit (KVPU) of DRE is specifically
designed to execute the fine-grained, data-dependent, and conditional
operations of ReSV, such as bit-level clustering and thresholding with
early-exit sorting, that would cause severe slowdown and
underutilization on a GPU. Additionally, the KV cache management unit
(KVMU) of DRE complements this by managing PCIe bandwidth efficiently
and reducing overall data movement during retrieval. By offloading these
irregular tasks to a specialized unit, V-Rex allows the main LLM engine
to operate at peak efficiency.

achieving up to 19.7 × speedup and 18.5 × energy savings over a state-
of-the-art GPU baseline.

## II. BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATIONS

## A. Streaming Video LLM Architecture and Workflow

Figure 2 presents an overview of the streaming video LLM. Unlike offline
models, it processes real-time streaming video input and generates
narration in direct response to user queries. Users may issue a series
of queries, including follow-ups that depend on both previous
interactions and the evolving video context. Consequently, information
from earlier video segments is vital for producing context-aware
responses to future queries. This operational need underscores the
importance of advanced KV cache management algorithms that preserve and
utilize prior visual context, rather than relying on conventional
optimization methods (i.e., pruning, merging, and quantization) [12],
[13], [17], [19], [21], [34], [36], [37] that may discard information
essential for subsequent interactions.

Figure 3 shows the model architecture of streaming video LLM. A
streaming video LLM consists of three core modules: a vision tower, an
MLP projector, and an LLM. The vision tower (e.g., CLIP [27], SigLIP
[44]) transforms each video frame into numerical embeddings that capture
spatial and temporal features. The MLP projector adapts the dimension of
these embeddings, enabling seamless integration with the LLM input
space. The LLM processes visual information and user queries, generating
output tokens. For the LLM, models such as Llama-3 [8] and Qwen3 [40]
are often used.

The streaming video LLM first performs iterative prefill stage that
sequentially processes video inputs and question tokens, a distinctive
mechanism unique to handling real-time video streams. Since sampled
frames in a real-time video stream arrive sequentially and cannot be
batched together, each frame is processed individually through a
repeated prefill computation of LLM. Each prefill stage attends previous
KV cache for the self-attention computation and generates KV cache
entries that are incrementally accumulated. This KV cache grows linearly
over time, following an O ( N 2 T ) complexity, where N 2 represents the
spatial resolution and T denotes temporal duration. Notably, this cache
facilitates the processing of future frames and is crucial for
generating accurate responses to user questions, as queries may
reference visual information spanning multiple frames. When the user
inputs a query, the user's question is tokenized and processed solely
through the LLM. In the generation stage, it generates output based on
both the accumulated frame KV caches and the question tokens, thereby
maintaining contextual coherence.

## B. Principles of KV Cache Retrieval

Figure 4 (a) shows the overhead of the KV cache of VideoLLM-Online [4]
when using Llama-3 8B as the backbone model. The KV cache increases with
video duration and exceeds GPU memory capacity within minutes, making
edge deployment impractical. Prior research attempts to reduce KV cache
size through pruning and merging, but it falls short for streaming video
LLMs in multi-turn settings. Discarding segments of the cache results in
inaccurate responses to sequential user queries. In contrast, KV cache
retrieval preserves all prior information and enables selective
computation, thereby reducing memory requirements while preserving model
accuracy. This is achieved through a three-stage process during
inference. (1) Offloading: the entire KV cache is first transferred to
CPU memory or storage. (2) Selection: only relevant tokens are selected
for the query. (3) Pre-fetching: these selected KV entries are retrieved
to the GPU memory in advance for attention computation. This design
ensures three essential outcomes: 1) It upholds contextual integrity
across multi-turn queries, 2) minimizes the GPU memory requirements, and
3) reduces computation by limiting processing to the most relevant
subset of the cache per query. Thus, KV cache retrieval offers both
scalability and coherence for realtime streaming video LLMs.

## III. CHALLENGES OF KV CACHE RETRIEVALS

## A. Why KV Retrievals Fall Short in Streaming Video LLMs

Applying existing KV cache retrieval techniques to streaming video LLMs
poses fundamental limitations that have not been addressed in prior
works. For instance, InfiniGen [16] is a representative algorithm that
effectively hides retrieval latency during the LLM's generation stage.
However, in real-world streaming video LLM scenarios, this advantage has
minimal impact because such systems are dominated by an iterative
prefill stage, which utilizes KV caches, driven by continuous incoming
frames and multi-turn queries. InfiniGen and other similar approaches
operate exclusively during generation and thus do not address the
predominant bottleneck during prefill, where the bulk of KV cache
retrieval and generation occurs.

<!-- image -->

We analyzed the breakdown of end-to-end latency of streaming video LLM
using InfiniGen on an NVIDIA A100 GPU by modeling the average working
scenario on the COIN benchmark (i.e., 26 frames, 25 question tokens, and
39 answer tokens), assuming a specific length of the KV cache sequence
has been pre-computed and is actively maintained, as shown in Figure 4
(b). The results reveal that as video duration increases, the number of
accumulated KV cache tokens grows rapidly, making prefill the largest
contributor. At 80K cache sequence length, 83% of the latency is taken
by the prefill stage and 74% of this prefill latency is taken by the KV
cache retrieval, confirming it is the true bottleneck. Since the prior
retrieval method only optimizes the generation stage, it fundamentally
fails to tackle the most critical memory and performance bottlenecks in
streaming video LLMs. Without directly addressing KV cache management
during frequent prefill, it is not possible to achieve practical gains
in memory efficiency or system responsiveness under streaming workloads.

## B. Limitations of Adapting Retrieval Algorithms

Adapting GPU-oriented retrieval algorithms (FlexGen [30], InfiniGen,
ReKV [6]) to streaming video LLM prefill stages causes significant
inefficiency due to KV prediction computation and CPU-GPU data transfer
overhead. The computation overhead for KV prediction increases as the KV
cache sequence increases. In addition, in streaming scenarios, the Query
matrix consists of multiple tokens, each requiring different KV cache
entries, necessitating larger token budgets than those for text
generation. To empirically illustrate these issues, we measure the
latency breakdown of streaming video LLM at 40K KV cache sequence length
when InfiniGen is adopted for the prefill stage with token budget of 10K
on an NVIDIA A100 GPU, as depicted in Figure 4 (c). The KV cache
retrieval includes both KV prediction computation and memory transfer
latencies. Results show that the KV cache retrieval computation only
accounts for 23%. However, it accounts for 85% of the total latency,
where 40% is attributed to the KV prediction computation and 39% to the
KV cache fetch from CPU memory. We additionally confirmed this issue
with other SOTA retrieval methods (i.e., FlexGen and ReKV),
demonstrating a similar trend. Furthermore, this issue becomes more
severe as the token sequence length increases, causing larger KV
prediction computation and data retrieval. These results highlight that
existing GPU-oriented algorithms cannot efficiently handle prefill-heavy
streaming workloads. Addressing this bottleneck requires fundamentally
new approaches.

## C. Inflexibility of Fixed Top-K Selection

Many GPU-oriented algorithms, including InfiniGen and ReKV, favor top-k
selection in KV cache management to take advantage of the predictable
resource allocation and efficient parallel processing inherent to GPU
architecture. However, this static approach imposes fundamental
limitations for streaming video LLMs. Crucially, the score matrices that
determine token importance vary widely across different transformer
layers and attention heads, reflecting that diverse features are
captured throughout them. Consequently, a different set of tokens is
selected as important by each unique layer and head. Prior studies have
shown that fixed top-k selection frequently results in redundant tokens
or loss of relevant tokens, since the optimal K shifts by layer and head
[7], [36], [41].

These inefficiencies are exacerbated in streaming edge environments,
where memory budgets are limited and strict latency constraints apply.
In such contexts, over-provisioning KV cache due to inflexible top-k
policies leads to avoidable resource overhead and longer response times,
undermining system scalability and energy efficiency. Additionally, the
nature of streaming video LLMs requires the video data to be streamed,
and the sequence length increases in real-time, necessitating the
adaptive adjustment of the number of selected tokens to ensure
efficiency and accuracy. To this end, V-Rex is explicitly designed to
address these challenges, providing finegrained, importance-driven
dynamic selection that reduces KV cache size and retrieval cost for
practical, real-time inference even on resource-constrained edge
platforms.

## IV. V-REX: UNIFIED SW-HW CO-DESIGN STRATEGY

To address the challenges of streaming video LLMs, we propose V-Rex, a
software-hardware co-designed solution. Figure 5 illustrates how each
component of our optimization stack reduces decoder layer latency. At
the software level, V-Rex implements ReSV, an enhanced KV cache
retrieval algorithm that efficiently selects and fetches only the most
relevant entries from CPU memory or storage, where full caches are
offloaded. It improves upon prior methods by using hash-bit key
clustering and WiCSum thresholding. Leveraging the high temporal and
spatial similarity in video frames, the algorithm achieves lightweight
computation and efficient KV selection. At the hardware level, V-Rex
integrates compact units to accelerate these operations and minimize
retrieval overhead. It decouples these operations from the main LLM
computation pipeline, enabling latency hiding and end-to-end
optimization.

## A. ReSV: Efficient and Accurate KV Cache Retrieval

ReSV is a training-free algorithm designed to optimize KV cache
retrieval during the iterative prefill stage of streaming video LLMs. As
shown in Figure 6, it consists of two main stages: KV retrieval and
execution. In the retrieval stage, KV prediction is performed on-the-fly
immediately after QKV generation to capture the dynamic nature of the
cache. Selected KV tokens are prefetched for the next decoder layer,
hiding fetch latency during execution. KV prediction involves two steps.
First, hash-bit key clustering groups similar tokens using lightweight
bitwise operations, generating representative keys ( Key cluster ) by
averaging within each cluster. This reduces computation by limiting
attention to representative keys. Second, WiCSum thresholding
dynamically selects the most important Key cluster , adapting to varying
data distributions across layers and attention heads, unlike fixed top-k
methods. In the execution stage, the model performs light attention
using only the selected clusters, significantly reducing memory and
compute by fetching only essential KV entries.

## B. Hash-bit Key Clustering for Fast Similarity Grouping

The rationale for hash-bit key clustering lies in the high similarity
among tokens in adjacent frames, as shown in Figure 7 (a). Leveraging
this property, the method performs spatial-temporal clustering of key
caches to efficiently reduce redundancy across frames. Unlike merging
methods that replace multiple tokens with a single representation which
requires higher precision, this approach preserves original token values
for the execution stage. Thus, it avoids expensive operations like high-
dimensional cosine similarity by using ultra-low-dimensional
representations ( ≤ 0.5% of the original dimension) and lightweight
hash-bit hamming distance computations. Figure 7 (b) proves that our
hash-bit hamming distance can effectively follow the trend of cosine
similarity, having a 0.8 correlation value, which is enough to perform
clustering.

The clustering process consists of two main steps: hashbit generation
and hamming distance clustering, as shown in Figure 8. In the hash-bit
generation step, computation is performed each time a new frame arrives.
The key matrix, obtained after applying the rotary position embedding
operation to the current frame, undergoes dimensionality reduction in
two directions to significantly reduce the overhead of the following
hamming distance clustering. A set of N hp random hyperplanes is
generated, and the key matrix is multiplied by these hyperplanes,
producing a reduced-dimension matrix Key hp with N hp embedding
dimensions. Each element of Key hp is then binarized: values less than
or equal to zero are set to 0, and values greater than zero are set to
1, converting each element into a single bit to form the Key hash-bit .

Next, hamming distance clustering is performed. It involves calculating
hamming distance between the newly generated current Key hash-bit and
the combined Key cluster hash-bit , which includes previous and current
Key hash-bits . The hamming distance is computed by performing a bit-
wise XOR operation between tokens and counting the number of differing
bits. Tokens with distances below a hyperparameter-defined threshold (
Th hp ) are clustered. The final clustering results are stored in a hash
cluster (HC) table containing the cluster index, token index, Key
cluster , Key cluster hash-bit , and token count. This method enables
clustering with very low computational

overhead that typically grows with token count while maintaining high
clustering accuracy, making it well-suited for efficient KV cache
selection in streaming video LLMs.

## C. Dynamic Token Selection via WiCSum Thresholding

WiCSum thresholding is a dynamic selection algorithm developed to
address the diverse score distributions that occur across different
layers and attention heads. Unlike static top-k methods that select a
fixed number of tokens regardless of their importance, WiCSum
thresholding dynamically determines the number of tokens to select for
each layer and head. This dynamic approach enables more accurate and
efficient KV cache retrieval, minimizing unnecessary memory and
computational overhead, thereby supporting low latency and high
efficiency.

Figure 9 shows the overall dataflow, composed of two main steps: Query ×
Key T cluster computation and threshold checking. In the first step, the
algorithm computes the matrix multiplication between the current query
vectors and the representative Key cluster generated by the previous
hash-bit key clustering stage. Because this computation uses only the
representative Key cluster values rather than the entire key cache, it
significantly reduces the computational overhead. The result of this
operation is the Score cluster matrix, which reflects the relevance of
each Key cluster to the current query.

Fig. 10. Overall Architecture of V-Rex

<!-- image -->

In the threshold checking step, important elements in the Score cluster
matrix are selected. For each row i in the matrix, it calculates a
weighted sum ( Sum i ) by multiplying each score by its corresponding
token count and summing the results, as shown in Equation 1. This
weighted sum is then used to compute a threshold ( Th wics ) by
multiplying it by a predefined ratio hyperparameter ( Th r -wics ), as
shown in Equation 2. Then, each row of Score cluster is sorted in
descending order, where σ is the sorting permutation. Starting from the
highest Score cluster value, the weighted sum with the token count is
accumulated until the minimum t , when Acc i ( t ) exceeds the threshold
Th wics i , as shown in Equation 3. The indices of the clusters selected
up to this point are aggregated across all rows, and these selected
cluster indices are then mapped back to the original token indices using
the HC table to produce the final set of selected tokens.

## V. V-REX'S HARDWARE ARCHITECTURE

The ReSV effectively reduces the number of required tokens.
Nevertheless, the core operations introduced by ReSV present
inefficiencies on GPUs. These inefficiencies arise from 1) conditional
and data-dependent computation of ReSV's clustering and thresholding,
which makes it difficult to fully exploit parallelism, and 2) irregular
and sparse KV cache fetching from SSD and CPU memory, which causes
underutilization of PCIe bandwidth, both resulting in increased latency.
To address these challenges, we introduce V-Rex with a low-latency,
compact KV cache retrieval engine specifically designed to support the
unique computational patterns of ReSV and optimize the memory-intensive
KV fetching by efficiently handling the irregular memory access
patterns. Additionally, it can be easily integrated with existing
hardware, including GPUs and NPUs, for high adaptability.

## A. Architecture Overview

Figure 10 illustrates V-Rex's hardware system, which consists of three
primary components: the V-Rex accelerator, offchip memory, and storage
or CPU memory for the full KV cache. The V-Rex accelerator, which
comprises the LLM execution engine (LXE) and DRE, is responsible for the
primary computational tasks required by streaming video LLMs. The
execution flow proceeds as follows: 1 LXE generates hashbits for current
frame keys, 2 hash-bit cluster unit (HCU) performs hamming distance
clustering and updates HC table, 3 LXE computes Q × K T cluster then
send Score cluster to WiCSum threshold unit (WTU), 4 WTU executes WiCSum
thresholding with early-exit sorting, determining which token entries to
retrieve, 5 KVMU prefetches selected KV entries from storage, and 6
retrieved KV tokens are used in attention.

LLM Execution Engine. LXE processes the primary LLM operations and two
computations from ReSV. The hash-bit generation and Query × Key T
cluster computation of ReSV are processed in LXE, as it involves mainly
matrix multiplications and vector computations. The LXE is based on the
core architecture of the LPU [23], which integrates a dot product engine
(DPE) for high-throughput matrix multiplication and a vector processing
engine (VPE) for efficient vector operations, both with BF16 precision.
DPE is composed of N DPE -h MAC trees, receiving N DPE -w inputs. The
VPE is composed of N V PE -h vector units and accepting N V PE -w
inputs.

## B. Dynamic KV Cache Retrieval Engine (DRE)

The DRE consists of a KVPU and KVMU, which are responsible for the
computations and memory management required during dynamic KV cache
retrieval. The KVPU integrates both HCU and WTU, which together
accelerate the most latency-critical operations in KV cache retrieval.
By offloading these tasks from the main compute pipeline, V-Rex
significantly reduces computational and data fetching bottlenecks.

Fig. 11. Dataflow of Early Exit Sorting

<!-- image -->

Hash-bit Cluster Unit. At the core of the KVPU, the HCU is responsible
for executing the hash-bit key clustering process. The HCU is a compact
computing module, consisting of three main components: a current hash-
bit memory, a key cache hash-bit memory, and N HCU -h parallel XOR
accumulators, each capable of processing N HCU -w inputs. The HCU
receives the key hash-bit vectors from the LXE and stores them in the
current hash-bit memory. Simultaneously, it retrieves key cache hash-bit
clusters from the HC table and stores them in the key cache hash-bit
memory. Both of these are structured as bit matrices to enable efficient
parallel operations.

To perform clustering, the HCU initiates the computation of hamming
distances between the current hash-bit vectors and the stored key cache
hash-bit clusters. This process utilizes XOR accumulators to identify
differences between corresponding bits across the matrices. The
accumulators then sum the number of differing bits to calculate the
hamming distance for each comparison. By comparing the computed hamming
distances with the predefined threshold Th hd , the HCU efficiently
groups tokens with similar hash-bit patterns into clusters. Then, the
clustering results are stored in the HC table. This hardware-accelerated
approach enables rapid and energy-efficient clustering using bitwise
operators, supporting the low-area requirements for edge deployment.

WiCSum Threshold Unit. The WTU accelerates the WiCSum threshold check,
enabling low-latency selection computation. It consists of multiple
parallel WTU cores, each equipped with score memory, token count memory,
and a dedicated computing unit for thresholding. Each core includes
upper and lower bucket sorters, multipliers, an adder tree, and a bucket
range updater. The most computationally intensive operations, sorting
and threshold checking, are efficiently handled by the WTU's dataflow,
which utilizes early exit sorting. It combines two operations in a fine-
grained pipeline and terminates sorting in the middle when it exceeds
the threshold, as shown in Figure 11. This process is divided into two
main steps: the preprocess step and the token selection step. In the
preprocess step, the WTU cores precompute values needed for the token
selection step, such as the weighted sum of scores and token counts for
each row, the min/max score values, and the threshold Th wics . During
the token selection step, the process begins with the bucket containing
the highest score range. The WTU performs bucket sort, cumulative sum,
and threshold checking in the pipeline. The bucket sort, which is highly
parallelizable, uses the preprocessed information to determine the upper
and lower bounds for each bucket, and the sorters generate bitmasks
indicating which scores fall within the current range. The selected
values are then multiplied and summed to compute the weighted sum, which
is compared to Th wics to decide whether to exit or continue. This early
exit mechanism is effective because a small number of large scores
typically account for the majority of the weighted sum (average 16% per
row), allowing the threshold to be reached quickly by starting with the
highest buckets.

Fig. 12. Hierarchical Memory System and Cluster-wise Memory Mapping

<!-- image -->

## C. KV Cache Management Unit

The KVMU manages the KV cache's memory for streaming video LLMs. It is
responsible for two main functions: hierarchical KV cache memory
management and hash clusterbased memory mapping. First, KVMU oversees a
hierarchical memory system, as illustrated in Figure 12, to efficiently
manage data movement between V-Rex's memory, CPU memory, and storage.
Recent KV cache entries are stored in V-Rex's memory for fast access.
When the total size of the KV cache in V-Rex's memory exceeds a
predefined maximum capacity, the oldest entries are offloaded to CPU
memory or storage. These offloaded entries can be retrieved from CPU
memory or storage and brought back into V-Rex's memory when needed for
computation. This hierarchical memory system ensures that both the most
recent and retrieved KV cache entries are available for computation,
while older or less critical data is kept off-chip to significantly
reduce memory overhead.

Second, KVMU implements an efficient memory mapping strategy based on
hash clusters. To maximize PCIe bandwidth utilization, tokens that
belong to the same hash cluster are grouped and stored at contiguous
memory addresses. The clustering is carried out entirely within the
recent KV cache, removing any need to access the CPU or storage for
clustering with the offloaded cache. This arrangement enables more
efficient use of memory bandwidth, as multiple tokens from the same
cluster can be transferred together in a single operation. Each time new
KV cache entries are generated for a frame, KVMU reorders and stores
them in memory according to the latest clustering results. Because KVMU
handles this reordering internally, the KV cache is stored in a
streaming fashion, and any latency associated with reorganization is
effectively hidden. Although this memory mapping is technically feasible
on conventional GPUs, it is highly impractical because it requires fine-
grained, online data reorganization. This process incurs substantial
latency overhead that ultimately nullifies the benefits of the optimized
layout, as it involves frequent perlayer computations and irregular,
memory-intensive scattering operations. To this end, KVMU ensures that
streaming video LLMs can access critical cache data with low latency,
maintain a reduced memory footprint, and utilize available bandwidth
optimally through these two mechanisms.

## VI. EVALUATION

## A. Experimental Setup

Performance. To evaluate the performance of V-Rex's hardware system, we
developed a custom cycle-level simulator. For DRAM performance, we
integrated DRAMSim3 [18], a widely used DRAM simulator, and for SSD
performance, we incorporated MQSim [35], an SSD simulator. To accurately
model data movement between CPU memory and GPU memory, the actual data
transfer bandwidth is modeled using an NVIDIA A100 GPU [3] and an AGX
Orin GPU [2], both of which are incorporated into the simulator. We
compared V-Rex against two representative GPUs-an edge device (Jetson
AGX Orin) and a server GPU (NVIDIA A100)-using identical system and
performance parameters, summarized in Table I. For the edge scenario,
V-Rex was instantiated with eight cores, utilizing the 4 GB/s PCIe with
M.2 NVMe SSD for offloading the KV cache and 204.8 GB/s LPDDR5 of
256-bit bus. For the server scenario, V-Rex utilized 48 cores, achieving
a total of 319 TFLOPS, with 1935 GB/s HBM2e of 5120-bit bus and 32 GB/s
PCIe with offloading the KV cache to DDR4-based CPU memory. For the
streaming video LLM, all experiments employ Llama-3 8B as the backbone

DRAM, PCIe, and storage Included

Design Compiler on a 14nm process. It operates reliably at 0.8 V and 800
MHz without timing violations under nominal conditions, as confirmed by
pre-layout static timing analysis. DRAM (HBM2e, DDR4) behavior was
modeled using DRAMSim3, and LPDDR5 energy data were taken from vendor
reports [11], [15]. PCIe power was estimated at 3 W per lane under full
load, and SSD power was based on Kioxia BG6 specifications [1]. GPU
power measurements were obtained via NVIDIA-SMI and tegrastats [25],
[26]. All these parameters were integrated into our custom simulator for
accurate system-level evaluation. This setup ensures a realistic and
fair comparison against baseline edge and server GPUs.

## B. Performance and Efficiency Evaluation

Latency. To evaluate V-Rex 's performance for streaming video LLMs, we
compared its latency in frame processing and text generation against
four top-k-based retrieval methods on both edge and server GPUs. FlexGen
[30] serves as the baseline, offloading KV caches to CPU memory (A100)
or storage (AGX Orin). InfiniGen [16] retrieves tokens only during
generation, InfiniGenP extends this to prefill, and ReKV [6] performs
frame-level selection. All baselines conduct KV prediction in the
previous attention layer to prefetch KV caches, overlapping fetch
latency with computation. We varied KV cache sizes (1K, 5K, 10K, 20K,
40K) using COIN [31], calibrating each method's selection ratio to match
baseline accuracy. Latency was measured as per-frame latency during
frame processing and time per output token (TPOT) during text
generation.

Latency comparison on the edge GPU is shown in Figure 13 (a). As token
length increases, per-frame latency and TPOT rise across all prior
methods due to heavier attention computation, greater selection
overhead, and larger KV transfers, driven by fixed top-k requiring high
token selection ratios. Consequently, none of the edge GPU setups-
AGX+FlexGen, InfiniGen, InfiniGenP, or ReKV-achieve real-time
performance at longer sequences, with the gap widening as token length
grows. In the frame processing stage, the abundance of Query tokens
demands higher retrieval ratios than in text generation, since each
query token requires retrieval. AGX+InfiniGen and AGX+InfiniGenP are
even slower than the FlexGen baseline due to fine-grained, token-level
selection introducing significant preprocessing overhead. AGX+ReKV's
coarse, frame-level selection offers modest latency gains but still
requires selecting many tokens to maintain accuracy, limiting its
effectiveness.

In contrast, V-Rex 8 enables real-time streaming inference ( ≥ 2 FPS)
even with long sequences and large batches. With a batch size of 1, per-
frame latencies are 121 ms, 123 ms, 198 ms, 200 ms, and 254 ms for cache
sizes of 1K, 5K, 10K, 20K, and 40K, respectively. It maintains 3.9-8.3
FPS across all sizes for real-time edge deployment, achieving 2.2-7.3 ×
speedups over AGX+FlexGen. When the batch size increases to 4, speedups
rise to 2.1-13.8 × . In text generation, TPOT latencies are lower, 89 to
97 ms, yielding 1.9-15.1 × speedups. These gains stem from minimizing
selected KV volume via ReSV and leveraging DRE's high-speed compute and
data movement. To evaluate scalability, we tested V-Rex 48 and an A100
GPU for server-level comparison (Figure 13 (b)). V-Rex achieves 20-48 ms
per-frame latency, with 2.6-7.3 × speedups at batch size 1. At batch
size 8, speedups increase to 3.4-19.7 × , demonstrating strong parallel
efficiency. TPOT latencies of 14-15 ms yield 2.8-16.8 × speedups. These
results show that V-Rex significantly reduces latency in both frame
processing and text generation for streaming video LLMs over edge and
server GPUs.

E2E Latency Breakdown. As shown in Figure 14, we evaluated the latency
breakdown of AGX Orin and V-Rex 8 in an end-to-end streaming video LLM
scenario, using an average case from the COIN benchmark. The results
demonstrate that AGX+FlexGen fails to mitigate this explosive growth, as
well as software-only optimizations (i.e., InfiniGenP and ReKV), which
even perform slower than FlexGen from 1K to 20K due to KV prediction
overhead. On the other hand, the primary performance gain of our work
stems from reducing the overhead of the iterative prefill stage,
increasing the performance gap as the KV cache sequence increases. This
results in a reduction of up to 5.4 × in end-to-end latency. By
effectively managing the KV cache during prefill, our method maintains a
consistent latency even as the cache grows.

Energy Efficiency. Figure 13 shows that V-Rex's energy efficiency gains
grow with token length, thanks to reduced data transfer. With batch size
1 during frame processing, V-Rex achieves 5.5-10.2 × greater energy
efficiency over AGX+FlexGen for KV cache sizes from 1K to 40K; with
batch size 4, the gain increases to 3.1-12.8 × . In text generation, the
improvement is even more pronounced, reaching 4.3-18.5 × . This
advantage is amplified on server GPUs, where power consumption is
higher. Compared to A100+FlexGen, V-Rex achieves 9.0-29.7 × higher
energy efficiency during frame processing with batch size 1. At batch
size 8, it delivers 1.1-1.4 TOPS/W, achieving 5.9-52.2 × gains. In text
generation, energy efficiency reaches 13.2-70.6 × . These improvements
stem from two key factors: ReSV 's ability to minimize retrieved data
volume, and the KVMU module's support for high-bandwidth, efficient data
fetching. As a result, energy consumption for PCIe-based data transfers
is significantly reduced. Overall, V-Rex delivers substantially higher
energy efficiency than state-of-the-art GPU-based retrieval methods,
making it a compelling solution for streaming video LLM acceleration.

Comparison with SOTA Accelerator. Figure 15 compares the throughput of
V-Rex 8 and Oaken [13], a state-of-the- art LLM accelerator using 4-bit
KV cache quantization, on the NVIDIA AGX Orin GPU. In this setup, AGX
Orin runs FlexGen without KV offloading, while Oaken applies online
quantization. At a short sequence length (1K), VRex achieves up to 1.5 ×
and 1.1 × higher FPS than AGX Orin and Oaken, respectively, due to fully
overlapped storage fetches and reduced attention computation. As
sequence length increases, AGX Orin encounters out-of-memory (OOM)
errors first, driven by the growing KV cache. Oaken, with its quantized
cache, handles longer sequences and maintains higher throughput, but
still fails beyond 20K tokens due to memory limits. In contrast, V-Rex's
efficient retrieval allows it to operate reliably beyond 20K tokens,
sustaining 7 FPS even at large sequence lengths.

Ablation Study &amp; Latency Breakdown. This evaluation illustrates how each
V-Rex optimization contributes to reducing latency and energy
consumption during frame processing. It first presents cumulative gains
as each optimization is applied, followed by a latency breakdown showing
which execution components are affected by each scheme. We implemented
AGX+ReSV by applying ReSV on the AGX Orin GPU and evaluated V-Rex 8 by
incrementally enabling optimizations under a 40K cache with batch size
1. V-Rex 8 KVPU includes the KVPU, while V-Rex 8 All incorporates all
optimizations, including KVMU. The results clearly demonstrate the GPU's
inefficiency and highlight the need for software-hardware codesign.

As shown in Figure 16, AGX+ReSV reduces overall latency by 2.8 × by
hiding most retrieval overhead under computation. However, due to
complex KV prediction, such as conditional and data-dependent
computation for clustering and thresholding, it still accounts for 48%
of total latency, limiting the algorithm's full potential on GPU. With
hardware-level optimization, V-Rex 8 KVPU reduces KV prediction latency
overhead down to 0.5% (from 23% of total computation), achieving a 6.0 ×
speedup and 9.2 × energy reduction by overlapping prediction operation
with LLM computation using HCU's fast bit-wise operations and WTU's
early-exit sorting. V-Rex 8 All further improves performance by
increasing PCIe bandwidth utilization, reaching an 8.1 × speedup and
10.2 × energy savings. Although KVMU introduces some memory overhead due
to the HC table, it occupies only 1.67% of the full KV cache with an
average of 32 tokens per cluster. Each V-Rex optimization contributes
incrementally to performance and energy efficiency. Notably, ReSV alone
is insufficient; the combined effect of ReSV and DRE is essential to
fully realize efficient KV cache retrieval for streaming video LLMs.

## C. Bandwidth Analysis for Concurrent Computation

To show that KV prediction and retrieval can be fully overlapped with
LLM computations, we analyzed the bandwidth usage of each computation
over a layer of frame processing stage, as shown in Figure 17. It
demonstrates that memory is effectively shared among concurrent
operations. The KV prediction is executed concurrently with the
attention operation. Although it briefly spikes bandwidth usage to
600GB/s, its short duration allows it to be hidden entirely. The KV
retrieval, which transfers data from CPU memory to DRAM, runs for most
of the execution time but only consumes about 1% of the bandwidth.
Because KV cache fetch is bottlenecked by PCIe bandwidth, which is about
1% of DRAM bandwidth, it allows KV retrieval to be concurrently executed
with attention and FFN computations with minimal overhead.

## D. Roofline Model Analysis

Figure 18 illustrates a roofline model analysis of the frame processing
stage for three edge-level systems: AGX+FlexGen, AGX+ReKV, and our
proposed V-Rex 8 . This analysis uses a workload with a KV cache length
of 40K and a batch size of 4, yielding an average operational intensity
of 15.2 Op/B. The result reveals a significant disparity in the achieved
throughput across the systems. AGX+FlexGen exhibits the lowest
performance, reaching only 6.6% of its theoretical maximum. This severe
underutilization is attributed to the slow PCIe communication, which
creates a bottleneck during KV cache fetching. Therefore, optimizing the
LLM inference computation alone is ineffective without resolving the
fundamental I/O bottleneck. AGX+ReKV employs a retrieval mechanism to
achieve a higher throughput, reaching approximately

15% of the peak. However, being a purely software-based optimization, it
remains inefficient. Finally, our proposed VRex demonstrates a
remarkable throughput at 71.5% of its theoretical maximum, marking a
10.8 × improvement over AGX+FlexGen. It confirms that V-Rex effectively
resolves the inefficiencies inherent in conventional GPU-based systems.

## E. Comparative Accuracy Analysis

Workload. To demonstrate the flexibility and accuracy of ReSV, we
evaluated and compared the performance of existing retrieval methods
(i.e., InfiniGen, InfiniGenP, and ReKV) using five benchmarks from the
COIN dataset. VideoLLMOnline [4] was used as the baseline without any
retrieval optimization applied. For this experiment, existing methods
were configured to select up to 50% of tokens with their fixed top-k
mechanism, while ReSV used a threshold in its WiCSum operation that was
empirically tuned to ensure the accuracy, configuring N hp =32, Th wics
to 0.3 and Th hp =7.

Accuracy. Table II summarizes the results. V-Rex's ReSV outperforms
other retrieval methods, demonstrating the lowest retrieval ratio while
achieving the highest overall accuracy. Compared to the baseline vanilla
model (VideoLLM-Online), ReSV exhibits only a marginal average accuracy
drop of 0.8%. Additionally, ReSV significantly reduces the retrieval
ratio, as it can adopt diverse score distributions from various tasks.
During the frame processing stage, the average retrieval ratio ranges
from 25.1% to 36.1%, and during the text generation stage, it varies
between 1.4% and 2.9%. This variability highlights that the thresholding
mechanism in ReSV effectively adapts token selection according to each
task's characteristics.

In contrast, InfiniGen maintains accuracy comparable to the vanilla
model, but it does not perform retrieval during the frame processing
stage, making it impractical for realtime inference. InfiniGenP
retrieves approximately 50% of tokens during the frame processing stage,
which leads to a substantial accuracy degradation of up to 3.4%. ReKV,
which employs frame-wise selection, requires a large volume of retrieved
KV cache for both frame processing and text generation stages to
maintain the accuracy as InfiniGenP, thus degrading the efficiency. In
summary, the hash-bit key clustering and WiCSum thresholding techniques
of ReSV enable dynamic adaptation to data distribution, effectively
selecting the minimal number of tokens while preserving accuracy. This
makes ReSV particularly suitable for real-time and resourceconstrained
streaming video LLM inference.

ReSV Efficiency. We performed an ablation study by incrementally
applying ReSV's optimizations. Figure 19 shows the average accuracy on
COIN benchmarks and the frame processing latency at 40K cache size.
First, ReSV without applying clustering improves latency by 1.6 × over
the baseline, causing a minor accuracy drop of 0.3%, originating from
the light attention computation. Second, ReSV, which further
incorporates hash-bit clustering, achieves a 9.4 × speedup, accompanied
by a 0.8% accuracy reduction. This significant speedup comes from
reducing the fetching and computing of the entire key for WiCSum
thresholding computation by clustering the key cache.

Figure 20 presents the ratio of retrieved data on a perlayer and per-
head basis of a sample video from COIN. Unlike InfiniGenP and ReKV,
which retrieve a fixed number of KV cache tokens uniformly across all
layers and heads, ReSV exhibits a diverse distribution in the token
retrieval ratio. Certain layers that require fewer tokens exhibit
selection rates of 4.2%, while more critical layers with higher token
importance demonstrate around 44.0%. This variability can also be
observed among the attention heads. It enables ReSV to maintain higher
accuracy while retrieving 3.0 × fewer tokens on average compared to
ReKV, resulting in superior efficiency compared to fixed top-k
mechanisms.

breakdown for V-Rex equipped with a single core. A single V-Rex core
occupies 1.89 mm 2 and consumes 2.61 W, equipped with on-chip memory of
384 KB for LXE and 20.125 KB for DRE. When scaled to larger
configurations, the area of V-Rex 8 is 15.12 mm 2 , which is
substantially smaller than the AGX Orin GPU (200 mm 2 ). Notably, V-Rex

occupies 90.57 mm 2 , considerably less than the A100 GPU (826 mm 2 ).
Including overall system power, V-Rex 8 consumes 35 W, achieving 11.4%
lower power consumption than the AGX Orin GPU (40 W), while V-Rex 48
consumes 203.68 W, demonstrating 32.1% lower power consumption than the
A100 GPU (300 W), as detailed in Table I. The additional hardware
overhead of DRE is minimal, accounting for only 2.4% of the chip's total
power and 2.0% of the total area, which can be attributed to the
effective KV cache retrieval algorithm. Its compact design enables
efficient integration with any existing GPUs, NPUs, and LLM
accelerators.

## VII. RELATED WORK &amp; DISCUSSION

Streaming Video LLM Optimization. VideoLLMOnline [4] introduces a
streaming video interaction system that adjusts frame sampling and
resolution. LiveVLM [24] focuses on reusable shortand long-term memory
tokens for efficient frame understanding. QuickVideo [28] leverages
parallel CPU decoding and GPU inference overlap to achieve end-to-end
speedups. VidMoD [37] reduces visual processing workload using mixture-
of-depth computation, dynamically skipping unnecessary layers. While
these systems improve frame processing efficiency, they still suffer
from repeated KV cache transfers and memory overhead during multi-query
streaming workloads. In contrast, V-Rex integrates clustering and
dynamic thresholding directly into the prefill stage to manage KV
transfers more effectively.

KVCache Management and Compression. To address the growing memory cost
of KV caches, various methods reduce KV size or selectively fetch
relevant tokens. LeanKV [46] employs multi-precision KV cache
quantization, where highprecision keys and low-precision values are
used. MiniCache [19] and PyramidInfer [41] compress based on layerwise
importance but leave inter-frame similarity unexplored. CacheGen [20]
exploits a traditional video codec mechanism but requires expensive pre-
processing overhead for compression, which is not suitable for streaming
applications. All these methods use fixed compression and pruning
policies that cannot adapt to the evolving attention patterns in video
streams. ReSV clusters similar tokens across frames, and its dynamic
token selection per layer and head yields more precise retrieval without
sacrificing context integrity.

Transformer Hardware Accelerators. Previous works primarily focused on
computational and memory bandwidth optimizations in accelerating LLMs.
DFX [10] and SpecEE [39]

target to accelerate the memory-bound generation stage. BitMoD [5] and
LUT Tensor Core [22] reduce computational overhead with a low-bit
inference method. While AiF [14] demonstrates in-flash processing for
on-device LLMs, it does not incorporate dynamic retrieval mechanisms.
Oaken [13] introduces KV cache quantization, which effectively increases
the maximum cache capacity but does not address the fundamental
structural issue of OOM errors caused by unbounded cache growth. Our
method can be applied on top of such prior techniques to further
optimize streaming video LLM inference and tackle challenges beyond
simple cache size expansion. For vision-oriented models, accelerators
such as Adaptiv [43] and EXION [9] primarily focus on improving compute
density. However, these designs do not directly address the growth of KV
cache overhead unique to streaming video LLM.

## VIII. CONCLUSION

We presented V-Rex, the first end-to-end accelerator and KV cache
management solution tailored for streaming video LLMs with dynamic KV
cache retrieval. Our contributions span the algorithm and hardware
levels. Through ReSV, a training-free, dynamic KV retrieval method,
V-Rex reduces KV cache volume with negligible accuracy drop. To support
ReSV efficiently, we designed a compact hardware unit, DRE, supporting
low-latency and energy-efficient computation. VRex enables real-time
streaming inference, achieving 3.98.3 FPS on an edge deployment with
1.9-19.7 × speedup and 3.1-18.5 × energy efficiency gains, and extends
to 2.6-19.7 × speedup gains and 5.9-70.6 × energy efficiency gains over
a server GPU. As KV cache retrieval becomes increasingly crucial in
long-context and streaming LLMs, we believe V-Rex presents a promising
direction for future research in real-time, energy-efficient LLM
acceleration, particularly for resourceconstrained edge environments and
scalable deployment.
