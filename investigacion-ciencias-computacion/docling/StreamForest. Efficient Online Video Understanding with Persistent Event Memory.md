## Abstract

Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently achieved
remarkable progress in video understanding. However, their effectiveness
in real-time streaming scenarios remains limited due to storage
constraints of historical visual features and insufficient real-time
spatiotemporal reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose
StreamForest , a novel architecture specifically designed for streaming
video understanding. Central to StreamForest is the Persistent Event
Memory Forest, a memory mechanism that adaptively organizes video frames
into multiple event-level tree structures. This process is guided by
penalty functions based on temporal distance, content similarity, and
merge frequency, enabling efficient long-term memory retention under
limited computational resources. To enhance real-time perception, we
introduce a Fine-grained Spatiotemporal Window, which captures detailed
short-term visual cues to improve current scene perception.
Additionally, we present OnlineIT , an instruction-tuning dataset
tailored for streaming video tasks. OnlineIT significantly boosts MLLM
performance in both real-time perception and future prediction. To
evaluate generalization in practical applications, we introduce ODV-
Bench , a new benchmark focused on real-time streaming video
understanding in autonomous driving scenarios. Experimental results
demonstrate that StreamForest achieves the state-of-the-art performance,
with accuracies of 77.3% on StreamingBench, 60.5% on OVBench, and 55.6%
on OVO-Bench. In particular, even under extreme visual token compression
(limited to 1024 tokens), the model retains 96.8% of its average
accuracy in eight benchmarks relative to the default setting. These
results underscore the robustness, efficiency, and generalizability of
StreamForest for streaming video understanding.

## 1 Introduction

In recent years, multimodal large language models have made significant
progress in video understanding tasks, demonstrating strong semantic
comprehension and reasoning capabilities across videos of varying
durations and scenarios [30, 52, 31, 35]. Benefiting from large-scale
pretraining and enhanced cross-modal modeling capabilities, these models
have been widely adopted in various domains [28, 42, 55, 59]. However,
with the growing demand for real-time intelligent processing in online
applications such as autonomous driving [49], live video streaming [6],
and robotics [79], researchers have increasingly shifted their focus
from conventional offline video understanding to the more challenging
task of streaming video processing [5, 23, 46].

In the field of streaming video understanding, efficiently caching
continuously arriving video frame features remains a long-standing and
challenging problem. To mitigate the storage and computational overhead
associated with past frames, prior work has primarily employed two
strategies for visual feature reduction: compression during sampling [5,
46, 64] and compression during storage [52, 72, 23]. Compression during
sampling reduces a large portion of incoming visual features, which
severely limits the model's capacity for fine-grained spatiotemporal
reasoning. As a result, it can only perform coarse semantic
summarization of the current scene. Conversely, compression during
storage typically involves merging or discarding adjacent frames based
on inter-frame similarity. While more memory-efficient, this strategy is
susceptible to missing critical foreground actions due to background
noise. It may also result in excessive local merging, introducing
spatiotemporal irregularities that degrade the model's ability to retain
and reason about key events over time.

To address the challenges of streaming video understanding, we propose a
novel architecture called StreamForest . At its core is the Persistent
Event Memory Forest , a mechanism designed to efficiently store and
manage long-term visual information. This memory system enables a MLLM
to process ultra-long streaming video at a constant rate of 1 fps by
dynamically organizing video segments into a tree structure based on
event boundaries. The merging of segments is guided by three penalty
functions that consider temporal distance, content similarity, and merge
frequency, ensuring an adaptive and meaningful memory hierarchy. To
enhance real-time perception, we introduce a Fine-grained Spatiotemporal
Window , which extracts rich local spatiotemporal features from nearby
frames. This module enables the MLLM to better understand the current
scene by focusing on temporally relevant visual context. We also present
OnlineIT , a fine-tuning dataset specifically designed for streaming
video understanding. OnlineIT improves the MLLM's ability to perceive
the present moment and anticipate future events by leveraging both
recent observations and long-term historical cues. It addresses the
problem of hallucinations caused by spatiotemporal distribution shifts
between past and current frames. In addition, we introduce ODV-Bench , a
new benchmark for evaluating streaming video understanding in autonomous
driving scenarios. ODV-Bench emphasizes real-time perception and future
prediction, providing a systematic framework for assessing the
generalization and real-world effectiveness of streaming video MLLMs in
downstream tasks.

We conducted extensive experiments on both online and offline video
understanding benchmarks to validate the effectiveness of StreamForest.
Under the default setting with a visual token limit of 8192,
StreamForest significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art
streaming video understanding MLLMs. It achieves an average accuracy of
77.3% on StreamingBench, 60.5% on OVBench, and 55.6% on OVO-Bench.
StreamForest also matches or surpasses the performance of leading
offline video understanding MLLMs on both long and short video
benchmarks, despite operating in a streaming video input setting.
Moreover, StreamForest demonstrates strong resilience under extreme
compression. With a reduced visual token limit of just 1024, it retains
96.8% of its average performance across eight benchmarks compared to the
default setting. These results highlight the robustness and efficiency
of our approach in continuously processing streaming video input.

Multimodal Large Language Model. Extending multimodal capabilities from
static images to dynamic video sequences introduces additional
complexity, requiring models to possess stronger abilities in modeling
long-range dependencies and understanding events [30, 40, 81, 41, 71,
58]. Recent advances in MLLMs for video have introduced a variety of
innovative strategies to tackle the challenges of efficiently processing
and reasoning over long video inputs [37, 42, 29, 51, 33]. LongVILA [7]
proposes a Multimodal Sequence Parallelism system for long-context
modeling, enabling efficient parallel training and inference on extended
video content. However, most current research on video understanding
remains focused on offline settings [57, 69, 62, 34], where the model
has full access to the complete video sequence before inference.
Although this setting facilitates global semantic modeling, it falls
short in streaming scenarios, where real-time understanding of
continuously evolving scenes is required. Therefore, the development of
models specifically designed for online video understanding is of
critical importance.

Streaming Video Understanding. In real-world applications, users
increasingly expect MLLMs to support online processing and real-time
interaction. This demand has prompted growing interest in the task of
streaming video understanding. Recently, several works have explored
this emerging area [5, 72, 63, 11, 61, 23]. However, most existing
streaming video understanding approaches are primarily designed for
streaming dense video captioning [5, 60, 32, 47, 12], focusing solely on
summarizing semantic content from visual frames. As a result, they
struggle to handle essential tasks such as memory recall and real-time
perception, which are critical for comprehensive streaming video
understanding. Moreover, in pursuit of computational efficiency, many
methods apply aggressive compression to video frame sequences [46, 74,
64], making them unsuitable for complex and dynamic tasks that require
fine-grained and real-time spatiotemporal understanding, such as
autonomous driving. To address these limitations, our goal is to develop
a more generalizable and practical approach for online video
understanding. It emphasizes fine-grained spatiotemporal features at the
moment of query and supports persistent memory storage based on events.

## 3 Methodology

## 3.1 Streaming Video Understanding Architecture: StreamForest

In this section, we detail our proposed StreamForest. Specifically, the
core design of StreamForest lies in Fine-grained Spatiotemporal Window
and Persistent Memory Forest, which work in tandem to enable the model
to retain long-term memories of past events while supporting real-time
perception.

## 3.1.1 Fine-grained Spatiotemporal Window

To meet the real-time spatiotemporal perception requirements of
streaming video understanding, we introduce the Fine-grained
Spatiotemporal Window (FSTW). We observe that in practical applications,
most of the clues requiring fine-grained spatiotemporal reasoning are
concentrated near the time of the question. Therefore, we retain only
second-level short-term fine-grained spatiotemporal features.

Specifically, the FSTW consists of two components: real-time perception
and short-term spatiotemporal memory. Real-time perception directly
samples high-resolution visual features from the current frame, which
are encoded with spatiotemporal positional information. As new frames
arrive, older frames are compressed along the spatial dimension and
transferred into short-term spatiotemporal memory. At the same time, the
model computes inter-frame similarity between new and old frames to
enable subsequent event-level segmentation. The short-term
spatiotemporal memory maintains a frame sequence with a duration of t s
seconds. When its capacity is exceeded, overflowing visual features are
offloaded into the Persistent Event Memory Forest. We segment continuous
visual features into meta-events by identifying the position with the
local minimum inter-frame similarity in the frame sequence. This ensures
that each meta-event captures a coherent spatiotemporal transition. A
meta-event is treated as an independent node, which consists of a
collection of visual tokens from similar consecutive frames. These nodes
form the foundation of the MLLM's long-term memory.

Figure 2: Overview of our proposed StreamForest. The Fine-grained Spatiotemporal Window captures instance-level spatiotemporal features, while the Persistent Event Memory Forest adaptively organizes event-level representations into a set of tree structures. Dashed arrows and feature tokens illustrate potential operations performed during each memory update iteration.

## 3.1.2 Persistent Event Memory Forest

To efficiently process continuously arriving video frame features in
streaming scenarios, we propose the Persistent Event Memory Forest
(PEMF), a memory architecture specifically designed to support long-term
memory in the context of streaming video. Unlike prior methods that rely
on direct interframe similarity compression [52] or static memory
hierarchies [23], PEMF adaptively compresses and organizes video
information at the event level. It constructs a hierarchical, tree-
structured memory guided by three penalty functions, enabling the model
to retain semantically rich and non-redundant content while managing
memory efficiently as it evolves over time. To control memory growth, we
impose an upper limit L q on the number of long-term memory tokens
stored in PEMF. When this limit is exceeded, PEMF performs hierarchical
memory consolidation by adaptively merging adjacent event nodes into
single nodes within the tree structure. The selection of nodes for
merging is guided by three penalty functions that account for temporal
distance, content similarity, and merge frequency, ensuring that the
memory remains both informative and compact.

Similarity Penalty. In long videos, adjacent video segments often
exhibit high visual similarity, resulting in substantial feature
redundancy. Therefore, we introduce a similarity penalty that encourages
the merging of event nodes with highly similar visual content. Due to
differences in event durations, two candidate event nodes (denoted as x
i , x i +1 ) may contain different numbers of visual tokens. To handle
this discrepancy, inspired by ToMe [3], we adopt a bipartite graph
matching approach. Specifically, we treat the visual features of the two
event nodes as sets in a bipartite graph and compute pairwise
similarities between tokens across these sets. Let X i ∈ R n i × d
denote the visual token features of the event node x i , where n i is
the number of tokens in x i . We compute the pairwise cosine similarity
matrix S i = sim ( X i , X i +1 ) ∈ R n i × n i +1 , and select the top
k i highest similarity scores, corresponding to the most similar token
pairs between two event nodes. The similarity penalty P s is defined as
one minus the average of these k i highest similarity scores:

Merge Count Penalty. When event nodes repeatedly participate in tree-
structured hierarchical memory merging, their visual details may
gradually degrade due to accumulated information loss. This degradation
can lead to local spatiotemporal inconsistencies, ultimately impairing
the accuracy of long-term video understanding. To mitigate this issue,
we introduce a merge count penalty as a regularization term. It
penalizes overly merged nodes and encourages a more balanced memory
integration process, thereby preserving the fidelity of each event
representation. Let c i denote the historical merge count of the event
node x i , with its maximum value at the query time denoted as c max .
We define the merge count penalty P m as follows:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Temporal Distance Penalty. In real-world streaming video understanding
scenarios, frames that are temporally closer to the current query time
often carry more relevant information. This observation suggests that
recent visual features should be preserved with higher fidelity, while
historical features can be compressed more aggressively. To implement
this intuition, we introduce a temporal distance penalty, which
encourages the model to retain more detailed representations of
temporally proximate events while promoting the forgetting of details
from distant past events. Let t q denote the current query or
interaction time, t i denote the time of event i . The calculation of t
i is detailed in the Appendix A. We define the time penalty P t as
follows:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Overall penalty. We incorporate the above three penalties to guide the
adaptive merging process of event nodes in the PEMF, where the
combination of these three factors determines the merge priority of
event node pairs.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

The penalty weights w s , w m , and w t collectively determine the
behavior of PEMF. When only the similarity penalty is applied, the
strategy degenerates into similarity-based compression. Using the merge
count penalty alone leads to behavior similar to uniform downsampling.
When the temporal distance penalty is used in isolation, the method
approximates FIFO. By adjusting these penalty weights, our method
enables a flexible trade-off among these strategies, allowing it to
adapt effectively to various streaming tasks, enabling a balance between
efficient storage saving and the retention of task-relevant information
across diverse real-world scenarios.

The nodes selected for merging are determined by identifying the pair
with the lowest overall penalty score. We employ ToMe [3] for the
merging process, compressing the number of visual tokens to half the
total tokens of the selected node pair. Upon receiving a user query, the
visual features of all root nodes in PEMF, along with all visual
features stored in FSTW, are fed into the LLM to support real-time,
streaming interaction.

## 3.2 Instruction-tuning Dataset: OnlineIT

Existing offline long video datasets often exhibit distributional bias,
where the key evidence for answering questions is typically concentrated
in the middle of the video. As a result, MLLMs fine-tuned on such data
tend to overemphasize historical content, potentially leading to
hallucinations in accurately interpreting the current moment. Although
some datasets for streaming video understanding have been released [5,
60, 63, 47], they remain limited in terms of data volume, quality, and
task diversity. To address these limitations, we construct OnlineIT, a
training dataset specifically designed for streaming video
understanding. OnlineIT focuses on fine-grained event comprehension and
real-time spatiotemporal understanding in streaming settings, and it
significantly enhances the performance of MLLMs on streaming video
understanding tasks.

OnlineIT-general. Based on criteria of diversity, length, and
difficulty, we curated and refined several existing high-quality fine-
tuning datasets of streaming video understanding [23, 60, 47]. Building
upon these, we further developed two new datasets comprising 32K high-
quality streaming training instances. This dataset features a larger
scale, broader distribution, and greater task diversity, facilitating
the learning of more generalizable streaming video representations.

OnlineIT-drive. It includes 89K streaming QA training instances from
autonomous driving scenarios. This dataset is designed to enhance MLLMs'
performance on complex, real-time downstream tasks. Specifically, by
integrating scene semantics, traffic regulations, and common driving
events, we extract key elements from driving scenes and video clips to
generate a question-answer dataset grounded in autonomous driving
contexts. OnlineIT-Drive primarily covers four areas: (1) real-time
localization and semantic awareness, (2) understanding of static traffic
entities, (3) understanding of dynamic traffic entities, and (4) risk
event and accident assessment.

## 4 ODV-Bench

Many existing benchmarks for streaming scenarios are derived from
offline video evaluation datasets [39, 23, 36, 61], and may not
adequately reflect real-world applications of streaming video
understanding. Although some of them already incorporate Ego4D videos of
daily activities [36, 61], these evaluation samples primarily evaluate
MLLMs' ability to perceive static scenes and narrate human-environment
interactions in a stepwise manner. In contrast, autonomous driving
presents dynamic, high-stakes environments with rapidly changing scenes,
complex multi-agent interactions (vehicles, pedestrians, and traffic
signals), and demanding prediction tasks (such as risk assessment and
motion planning). These scenarios require models to balance long-term
event memory with fine-grained short-term perception to avoid accidents
and make timely decisions. To address this gap, we introduce ODV-Bench,
a benchmark specifically designed for online video understanding in
autonomous driving scenarios.

## 4.1 Task Formulation

As shown in Figure 3 (a), we first explore the key traffic elements in
autonomous driving scenarios and summarize them into three categories of
task scenarios: (1) Static-target-oriented tasks , which involve the
recognition and retrieval of stationary traffic elements such as traffic
signs, lights, and road indicators; (2) Dynamic-target-oriented tasks ,
which focus on behavior and trajectory prediction of dynamic road
participants such as vehicles and pedestrians; and (3) Event-oriented
tasks for multi-agent interaction , which capture complex interactions,
risk scenarios, and accidents involving multiple agents. Next, guided by
temporal cues and the practical needs of driving, we further define
fine-grained task types based on these categories to comprehensively
assess model understanding in realistic online driving video scenarios.
For more details on task formulation, please refer to Appendix C.1.

## 4.2 Benchmark Construction

The construction process of ODV-Bench is illustrated in Figure 3 (b). We
adopt a four-stage approach to ensure the quality of each generated
question, and then present some typical task examples across different
driving scenarios in Figure 3 (c).

Data Collection. (1) Video Selection. To align with real-world driving
scenarios, we first curated 6 datasets [24, 14, 82, 66, 73, 4] from
different task scenarios within the autonomous driving domain, from
normal driving to unexpected events. Then, we designed a semi-automatic
pipeline that primarily relies on annotation filtering and YOLO-based
detection [25], supplemented by manual inspection, to select task-
relevant videos from the collected dataset. (2) Meta-Annotation
Generation. To obtain meta-annotations with detailed spatiotemporal and
semantic information, we developed tailored methods based on existing
dataset annotations. For well-annotated datasets, we effectively convert
existing labels into task-specific meta-annotations. For others, we
design a semi-automatic pipeline that begins with coarse annotations
generated by VLLM and YOLO [25], followed by structured human
verification to ensure quality.

Table 1: Evaluation results on ODV-Bench. Our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art offline and online video MLLMs under zero-shot testing conditions, and achieves further improvements after fine-tuning on driving-domain data.

QA Construction. (1) MCQ Generation. To enable efficient automatic QA
generation, we first design accurate and diverse templates tailored to
each defined task. These templates are then populated with fine-grained
and precise annotations to generate high-quality QA pairs. Next, we
develop a multiple-choice generation pipeline based on an option pool,
introducing plausible yet misleading distractors alongside the correct
answer to ensure the realism and effectiveness of choices. (2) Quality
Control. To ensure benchmark quality, we first conduct multiple rounds
of manual review to verify the clarity and accuracy of QA pairs and the
plausibility of distractor options. Besides, to enhance scene diversity
and task-type balance, we apply a sampling strategy that allocates
questions proportionally to video length, maximizing coverage across
scenarios.

## 5 Experiments

Implementation Details. We adopt SigLiP-so400M[70] as the visual
encoder, use an MLP as the projection head, and we employ Qwen2-7B as
the LLM. By default, the number of visual tokens is capped at 8192.
Among these, 729 tokens are allocated to real-time perception, while
short-term spatiotemporal memory consists of 18 frames, each represented
by 128 visual tokens. We set the penalty weights for similarity, merge
count, and temporal distance to 0.4, 0.4, and 0.2, respectively. The
model is trained on 32 A100 GPUs using our proposed OnlineIT dataset,
supplemented with offline video data from VideoChat-Flash [33] and
LLaVA-Video [76], as well as image data from LLaVA-OneVision [28]. We
adopt a five-stage training strategy to train StreamForest from scratch.
The first three stages follow the training paradigm of offline long
video MLLMs [33]. The fourth stage performs streaming video fine-tuning
to yield the base StreamForest. In addition, an optional fifth stage can
be incorporated by training with the OnlineIT-Drive, which yields the
StreamForest(FTdrive). During the evaluation phase, we constrain the
model to process streaming frames at 1 FPS. For more detailed
implementation specifics, please refer to the Appendix D.

## 5.1 Online Benchmark Results

We evaluate the performance of our model on four benchmarks for online
video question answering: ODV-Bench, StreamingBench [39], OVBench [23],
and OVO-Bench [36]. These benchmarks follow streaming video QA
scenarios, where the VideoLLMs must process only the video content
available before the current timestamp.

ODV-Bench. It closely integrates spatiotemporal information to
comprehensively evaluate MLLMs' ability to understand fine-grained
details in online videos and to make future predictions based on both
historical and current context in autonomous driving scenarios. The
benchmark includes tasks such as identifying subtle objects or actions,
describing object positions and spatial relations, and forecasting
object trajectories. These tasks require strong real-time spatiotemporal
perception and contextual understanding. As shown in Table 1,
StreamForest achieves an average accuracy of 59.9% on ODV-Bench without
being trained on OnlineIT-drive and further improves to 71.2% after
training on it. This significantly outperforms all existing online and
offline MLLMs, demonstrating the strong generalization capability of our
method to downstream streaming video understanding tasks. These results
highlight its potential for real-world applications.

StreamingBench &amp; OVBench &amp; OVO-Bench. As shown in Table 2, StreamForest
demonstrates strong performance across existing open-source streaming
video understanding benchmarks. It achieves an accuracy of 77.3% on
StreamingBench, 60.5% on OVBench, and 55.6% on OVO-Bench. These
impressive results highlight the robustness of StreamForest in a wide
range of online video understanding scenarios. The superior performance
of our model can be attributed to two key architectural innovations.
First, the Fine-grained Spatiotemporal Window enables precise spatial
perception and responsive short-term temporal modeling, which are
critical for real-time perception and forward responding tasks. Second,
the Persistent Event Memory Forest adaptively organizes long-term visual
content into a structured and efficient memory forest, significantly
enhancing the MLLM's ability to retain and reason over past events.
Together, these two modules offer complementary capabilities that allow
our model to handle dynamic, long-horizon streaming video inputs
effectively, while maintaining high contextual coherence.

## 5.2 Offline Benchmark Results

We further evaluate our method on two long video understanding
benchmarks (VideoMME[16] and MLVU[77]) and two short video datasets
(MVBench[31] and PerceptionTest[45]). In the offline setting, the entire
video is provided as input to the MLLM. We sample video frames at 1 FPS,
with a maximum limit of 2048 frames. For videos exceeding this limit,
frames are uniformly sampled across the entire duration. As shown in
Table 2, our method demonstrates superior performance on both long and
short video understanding tasks compared to recent state-of-the-art
online Video MLLMs. In addition, it outperforms leading offline models
in most benchmarks, achieving 61.4% on VideoMME, 70.0% on MLVU, 70.2% on
MVBench, and 73.1% on PerceptionTest. This strong performance in offline
scenarios highlights the robust generalization capability of our
proposed method.

## 5.3 Ablations

Effectiveness of the Persistent Event Memory Forest: We replace the
proposed PEMF with several methods used in previous work. To ensure a
fair comparison, we keep the visual token budgets consistent across all
methods and fine-tune each model accordingly. The ablation results Model

are shown in Table 3. The FIFO strategy shows the worst performance.
This is especially evident on the long-video benchmark MLVU (56.7% vs.
70.0%), where the method fails due to unfiltered discarding of
historical visual features. OVBench primarily emphasizes short-term,
fine-grained spatiotemporal perception. Uniform sampling reduces the
resolution of recent visual information, which is crucial for real-time
understanding (58.2% vs. 60.5% on OVBench). Similarity Merge achieves
performance comparable to our PEMF on OVBench (60.3% vs. 60.5%).
However, its limitations become clear in tasks that require persistent
memory and long-horizon reasoning. On OVO-Bench, PEMF outperforms
Similarity Merge by +2.2%, and on MLVU by +2.0%. This is because
similarity-based merging may over-merge frames within local video
segments, potentially leading to spatiotemporal irregularities and the
loss of local event-level representations. The pyramidal memory bank
maintains memory through frame replacement. However, fixed capacity
limits its ability to capture long-range spatiotemporal features (53.9%
vs. 55.6% on OVO-Bench and 68.2% vs. 70.0 on MLVU). In contrast, our
method evaluates each visual event based on event-level similarity,
merge count, and temporal distance. Then it performs memory
consolidation at the event level. This strategy supports efficient and
persistent maintenance of historical visual features.

Effectiveness of the Overall Architecture: We conduct ablation studies
on three key architectural components. Specifically, we ablate the Fine-
grained Spatiotemporal Window and the Persistent Event Memory Forest,
while ensuring that the total number of visual tokens remains consistent
with the original configuration. In addition, we replace event-based
node construction with a frame-based approach. As shown in Table 4,
removing both modules leads to the most significant performance drop.
Using either FSTW or PEMF alone improves performance compared to the
baseline, but the best results are achieved when both components are
integrated (+2.5% on OVBench, +3.1% on OVO-Bench, and +18.2% on MLVU).
This joint ablation confirms that FSTW and PEMF provide complementary
benefits. FSTW enhances real-time spatiotemporal perception near the
query timestamp, while PEMF supports efficient and persistent long-term
memory, together yielding the strongest overall performance. Moreover,
event-level node construction effectively prevents over-merging within
events, enabling the compression of visual features at the level of
complete visual events rather than individual frames.

Figure 5: Average inference time under varying visual token budgets (on
single A100 GPU).

Robustness to Different Visual Token Budgets: We evaluate the robustness
of our method under varying budget constraints for visual tokens,
ranging from 1K to 10K. Figure 4 illustrates the performance variation
on the benchmarks MLVU, VideoMME, and OVO-Bench under these settings.
Notably, under the strict constraint of only 1K visual tokens,
StreamForest achieves an average visual compression ratio of up to 99.8%
on long video benchmarks. Despite this extreme level of compression, the
model still maintains competitive performance, which strongly
demonstrates the robustness of our approach in persistently preserving
long-term, event-level visual memories. We also conduct a direct
comparison between our PEMF and the Similarity Merge. The results
clearly demonstrate two core benefits of our approach. First, PEMF
exhibits superior absolute performance, consistently outperforming
Similarity Merge across all token budgets with an average accuracy
improvement of 2-3%. Second, our method shows stronger resilience to
extreme compression. Under the most severe 1K token budget, PEMF retains
a higher fraction of its full-budget performance, achieving a notable
+1.8% relative retention advantage on VideoMME. These experimental
results confirm that the performance gains stem from the intrinsic
design of PEMF, which adaptively consolidates event-level memory to
preserve semantically salient information, thereby ensuring both high
accuracy and token efficiency under stringent resource constraints.
Figure 5 presents the average inference time of StreamForest under
different budgets of visual tokens. The fast and stable inference speed
highlights the practical applicability of StreamForest.

Computational cost: We provide a quantitative analysis of the runtime
and memory usage of StreamForest. To isolate the effect of the memory
mechanism, we assume that frame-level visual features are already
extracted by the vision encoder in real time. As shown in Table 5, PEMF
enforces a strict upper bound of visual tokens (8K here), ensuring that
memory usage remains stable ( ˜ 17 GB) regardless of the number of
processed frames. Consequently, the FLOPs and inference latency do not
grow significantly even with longer streaming inputs. In addition, we
compare PEMF with other memory mechanisms, including the Pyramid Memory
Bank [23] and the Similarity Merge strategy [52]. As summarized in Table
6, the overall runtime is dominated by vision encoding (5.2s for 500
frames, ∼ 95 FPS). The memory update of PEMF is extremely lightweight
(0.172s for 500 frames), which is negligible compared to the efficiency
gains achieved by significantly reducing the total number of visual
tokens.

Impact of Training Data: Table 7 presents the impact of our training
strategy that integrates both online and offline datasets. The results
clearly demonstrate that combining OnlineIT with existing offline
VideoQA datasets significantly improves performance on streaming video
understanding benchmarks. OnlineIT is specifically designed for real-
time perception and future prediction in streaming scenarios,
effectively mitigating hallucinations caused by inconsistencies between
historical spatiotemporal context and the current moment.

## 6 Conclusions

In this work, we have proposed StreamForest, a novel architecture for
streaming video understanding that addresses the limitations in long-
term memory and fine-grained perception. By introducing the Persistent
Event Memory Forest, our method effectively manages historical visual
information through adaptive merging guided by temporal distance,
content similarity, and merge count penalties. Coupled with the Fine-
grained Spatiotemporal Window, the model maintains a precise
understanding of the current scene. We also present OnlineIT, a
streaming video understanding fine-tuning dataset that mitigates
spatiotemporal shift issues and enhances real-time perception and
reasoning. As well as ODV-Bench, a new benchmark tailored for real-time
autonomous driving scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
StreamForest not only outperforms state-of-the-art streaming video MLLMs
but also rivals top offline video MLLMs under strict streaming input
settings, showcasing its robustness and practical value in real-time
streaming video understanding applications.

## A Details of node's timestamp

Each event node's timestamp is initialized as the average time of the
frames it represents (e.g., if an event node spans frames from 10s to
14s, its timestamp is initialized as 12s). When two event nodes are
merged, the timestamp of the new node is computed as a token-count-
weighted average of the original nodes:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where t i , t j are the timestamps of the original event nodes, and n i
, n j are the numbers of visual tokens contained in each node,
respectively. This weighted scheme prevents timestamp drift during
multiple rounds of merging, especially when the merged nodes contain
significantly different amounts of visual tokens.

## B Details of OnlineIT

In this section, we provide a comprehensive description of the task
categorization and data distribution of the OnlineIT dataset. It is
specifically designed to enhance the streaming video understanding
capabilities of MLLMs in terms of real-time perception, future
prediction, and event continuity. As shown in Table 8, the dataset is
divided into two major components: OnlineIT-general, which targets
general streaming video understanding, and OnlineIT-drive, which focuses
on autonomous driving scenarios. Each subset is carefully designed to
cover a diverse range of fine-grained perception and reasoning tasks
with high-quality annotations.

## B.1 OnlineIT-general

OnlineIT-general encompasses a broad scope of tasks designed to foster a
comprehensive understanding of spatiotemporal video content in streaming
settings. As shown in Table 8, the dataset is categorized into four
primary task types: spatial perception, temporal perception,
spatiotemporal perception, and event perception. To ensure diversity,
robustness, and fine-grained task coverage, we compiled and refined data
from a wide array of sources. In total, OnlineIT-general comprises over
400k instances spanning various difficulty levels and video durations.

Spatial Perception. This task type includes four subtasks. Spatial
Grounding requires the model to output the bounding box indicating the
location of a queried object. Multi-round Spatial Understanding involves
identifying the object's spatial location through multi-turn dialogue or
generating a caption for the object within a specified spatial region.
Spatial Grounded VQA combines visual question answering with spatial
localization, requiring the model to provide the bounding box of the
relevant area while answering the question. Relative Spatial
Localization challenges the model to determine the position of a
specified object relative to the overall scene. These tasks emphasize
spatial grounding and reasoning, which are crucial for enhancing a
model's fine-grained spatial perception in real-time streaming video
scenarios.

Temporal Perception. This category consists of three subtasks. Temporal
Grounding involves interpreting a natural language query and identifying
the start and end timestamps of the corresponding video segment. In
streaming scenarios, the model must also assess whether the described
event is currently ongoing. Reasoning Temporal Localization requires
identifying the relevant time span of an event while answering a
reasoning-based question. Multi-format Temporal Localization
incorporates both single-turn and multi-turn dialogues, covering a
diverse range of question formats. These tasks focus on strengthening
the MLLM's ability to track and reason about temporal dependencies,
improving its understanding of both current and past moments in a video
stream.

Spatiotemporal Perception. This task type integrates spatial and
temporal reasoning and includes three subtasks. Spatiotemporal Action
Localization requires the model to predict both the spatial location and
the action being performed by a target at a specific query time. Object
Backward Tracking tasks the model with identifying the current location
of an object and tracing its position at previous time points, such as
one or two seconds earlier. Spatiotemporal Detection operates over
broader temporal windows, asking whether an object visible in the
current frame existed several seconds ago or requiring the model to
locate an object at a specified historical moment and determine its
duration of existence. These tasks combine spatiotemporal cues to
capture actions, motion, and transitions, allowing the model to track
object trajectories and anticipate future states based on past and
present context.

Event Perception. This category includes two subtasks. Dense Video
Captioning involves detecting a sequence of events in a video and
generating corresponding timestamps along with high-level descriptions.
Step Localization and Captioning differs by focusing on segmenting and
narrating key procedural steps within long-form videos. These tasks are
aimed at improving the model's understanding of complex, multi-step
events, enabling structured interpretation of dynamic sequences in
streaming video understanding.

## B.2 OnlineIT-drive

OnlineIT-drive is designed specifically for the domain of streaming
video understanding in autonomous driving. The dataset includes 89k
instances, which are organized into three major task categories.
Collectively, these tasks aim to strengthen not only real-time
perception capabilities but also the temporal reasoning and decision-
making abilities of MLLMs in high-stakes and rapidly evolving
environments.

Static Target Understanding. To improve the model's capacity for static
scene understanding, two task types are introduced. Real-time Perception
requires the model to accurately perceive and interpret the semantics
and spatial attributes of traffic-related targets as they appear in real
time. Past Memory assesses the model's ability to retain and retrieve
the semantics and spatiotemporal characteristics of traffic targets that
were observed at a prior point in time. These tasks collectively enhance
the model's capability to perceive, understand, and remember static
traffic elements and environmental context, such as road infrastructure
and regulatory signage.

Dynamic Target Understanding. It includes two task types that aim to
enhance predictive understanding of dynamic traffic participants.
Location Prediction requires the model to estimate the future position
of a moving target based on its historical motion trajectory. Move
Distance Prediction focuses on predicting the distance traveled between
the ego vehicle and other moving agents, given motion-related
observations. These tasks are designed to improve the model's ability to
track continuously moving objects and to anticipate future trajectories.

Event Oriented Reasoning. It is intended to foster the development of
reasoning abilities necessary for risk assessment and accident
interpretation. Risk Analysis requires the model to detect potential
sources of danger in the current traffic scene and to assess the
likelihood of accident occurrence. Accident Reasoning involves post hoc
analysis, where the model must infer the causes of an observed accident
and articulate plausible preventive strategies. These tasks are designed
to enhance the model's ability to reason about causal relationships and
to anticipate or reflect on traffic risks with contextual awareness.

## C Details of ODV-Bench

In this section, we detail the task taxonomy and formulation of the ODV-
Bench, as well as the dataset statistics. We categorize task scenarios
based on target entities and derive key perception and reasoning task
types for each scenario in Table 9.

## C.1 Task Taxonomy and Formulation

We first identify the primary categories of traffic entities relevant to
autonomous driving and organize task scenarios into three groups: (1)
Tasks for Static Targets , which involve the recognition and retrieval
of stationary traffic elements such as traffic signs, lights, and road
indicators; (2) Tasks for dynamic targets , which focus on behavior
prediction and localization of moving entities such as vehicles and
pedestrians; and (3) Tasks for multitarget interaction events , which
capture complex interactions, risk scenarios, and accidents involving
multiple agents. Based on these categories and guided by temporal cues
and the practical needs of driving, we further define fine-grained task
types to comprehensively assess model understanding in realistic online
driving video scenarios.

Figure 6: Examples of each task in ODV-Bench. The 12 tasks are divided into three different perception modes for online video understanding for autonomous driving.

## C.1.1 Tasks for Static Targets

Static traffic elements, such as traffic signs and road indicators, play
a crucial role in driving decisions and hazard avoidance under normal
driving conditions. To evaluate the model's ability to retrieve and
recognize these elements in online video streams, we design a dedicated
set of tasks. Specifically, we distinguish between basic perception
tasks and more advanced reasoning tasks, and further refine them based
on temporal cues and practical driving needs: (1) Real-time Traffic
Perception: Perceive and interpret the semantics and spatial locations
of static traffic elements in real time; (2) Past Traffic Memory: Recall
and track the semantics and spatiotemporal states of previously observed
static elements; (3) Driving Decision-Making: make driving decisions
based on the perceived information; (4) Key Information Extraction:
Identify and locate key traffic elements critical to driving decisions;
(5) Hallucination Detection: identify questions irrelevant to the
existing video input; and (6) Traffic Change Detection: detect
timestamps for changes in traffic elements, such as traffic lights.

## C.1.2 Tasks for Dynamic Targets

The position and behavior of other road participants, such as vehicles
and pedestrians, are crucial reference factors influencing autonomous
driving decisions and safety. The ability to predict the position and
behavior of dynamic traffic objects is essential to ensure the safety of
autonomous driving. Therefore, we focus on the following three tasks to
effectively evaluate this capability: (1) Action Prediction: predicting
the next action of vehicles and pedestrians based on continuous
spatiotemporal cues; (2) Distance Prediction: predicting the relative
distance change between the ego-vehicle and other vehicles based on
motion information; and (3) Location Prediction: predicting the future
spatial position of dynamic traffic targets based on their movement
trajectories.

## C.1.3 Tasks for Multi-Target Interaction Events

To achieve safe and reliable autonomous driving, the system must be able
to identify risks and analyze accidents in complex road interaction
scenarios. In the context of online video streams, this ability involves
the dynamic recognition and analysis of multi-agent interactions, as
well as the reasonable prediction of traffic risks. To evaluate this
capability, we design the following three task categories: (1) Risk
Prediction: predicting the occurrence of significant traffic risks and
responding proactively; (2) Risk Analysis: detecting the sources of
current traffic risks and analyzing the potential causes of accidents;
and (3) Accident Reason Answering: post-accident analysis, providing
potential causes for the incident and summarizing actionable lessons
learned.

## C.2 Dataset Statistics

ODV-Bench comprises 1,190 unique first-person driving video clips,
encompassing a diverse range of driving scenarios across different
countries from routine driving conditions to potential hazards and
accidents. The length of videos ranges from 5 seconds to 90 seconds,
effectively capturing the diversity of real-world streaming driving
experiences. The benchmark includes 6,322 questionanswer pairs, with an
average query timestamp of 18.9 seconds. Specifically, the static-
object-oriented category comprises 247 videos with a total of 1,639
questions; the dynamic-object-oriented category includes 162 videos and
2,973 questions; and the event-oriented category consists of 781 videos
with 1,710 questions. All questions are in multiple-choice format, with
the number of options varying between 2 and 4 depending on the question
type.

We adopt a five-stage training strategy to systematically train the
proposed StreamForest model, aiming to fully exploit its potential for
streaming video understanding tasks. In the first three stages, we
follow and extend the training paradigm of VideoChat-Flash [33],
employing offline training to endow the model with strong capabilities
in long-form video comprehension and cross-modal alignment. These stages
are designed progressively, covering diverse data scales and task
objectives, enabling the model to gradually acquire core competencies
such as basic vision-language alignment, long-term temporal modeling,
and complex scene reasoning. Detailed training procedures and
hyperparameter configurations for these stages are provided in Table 10.

In the fourth and fifth stages, we perform online fine-tuning to enhance
the model's ability to process streaming inputs in realistic scenarios.
By continuously feeding frame sequences during training, the model
learns to retain a fine-grained perception of the current moment while
maintaining longterm memory of past events, even under high compression
constraints. The full configuration and parameter settings for the
online fine-tuning phase are listed in Table 11. These stages are
critical for transitioning the model from offline understanding to real-
time reasoning, significantly improving its robustness and practical
effectiveness in real-world applications.

## E Full Performances

In the following parts, we present the full results and compare
StreamForest with leading proprietary and open-source models. To
comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of StreamForest, we conduct
experiments on three online video understanding benchmarks:
StreamingBench, OVBench, and OVO-Bench.

## E.1 StreamingBench

Table 12 presents the full evaluation results on StreamingBench,
covering 12 real-time video understanding tasks. StreamForest achieves
the highest average score (77.26%) among all evaluated models, both
open-source and proprietary, while operating efficiently at 1 fps.
Notably, StreamForest outperforms leading proprietary MLLMs such as
GPT-4o (73.28%) and Gemini 1.5 Pro (75.69%). It also significantly
surpasses top open-source offline models such as LLaV A-OneVision
(71.12%) and Qwen2.5-VL (73.68%), underscoring its robust multimodal
representation and reasoning capabilities. In the online video MLLM
category, StreamForest sets a new state-of-the-art, outperforming open-
source counterparts Dispider (67.63%) by a wide margin. Its consistent
accuracy and real-time efficiency demonstrate a strong potential for
practical deployment in streaming applications.

## F Qualitative Comparison

Figure 7: Qualitative comparison between StreamForest and other method.

<!-- image -->

Figure 7 presents a qualitative comparison between our model and other
method. In the top example, StreamForest demonstrates a superior ability
to capture fine-grained visual details and maintain persistent memory
over time, enabling more coherent and informed inferences. The middle
example highlights StreamForest's strong spatiotemporal grounding
capabilities, accurately localizing objects and events across space and
time. The bottom example illustrates the model's potential in
intelligent driving scenarios, where it delivers precise real-time
perception and supports future predictions based on both historical and
current observations.

## G More Ablations

Figure 8: Ablation experiments of three penalty weights.

<!-- image -->

To evaluate the effect of each penalty on the effectiveness of long-term
memory, we conducted ablation studies by varying the weights of the
similarity penalty, merge count penalty, and temporal distance penalty.
The results are presented in Figure 8, which reports the accuracy of
both VideoMME and OVBench under different settings. It demonstrates that
a balanced combination of penalty weights is more effective.
Specifically, 0.4 for both similarity and merge count penalties, and 0.2
for the temporal distance penalty yield the most effective memory
construction. This configuration achieves a favorable trade-off between
preserving semantic coherence, maintaining diversity in memory
representation, and ensuring reasonable temporal continuity.

## H Efficiency of Multi-round Inference

We evaluated StreamForest's multi-round response efficiency by streaming
a 600-second video to the model at a constant rate of 1 FPS. To isolate
processing throughput from text generation latency, the model was
constrained to produce a single-token response for each frame. Under
this rigorous setting, StreamForest achieved an average processing speed
of 9.9 FPS, which is competitive with VideoLLMOnline (12.3 FPS), a model
renowned for its real-time capabilities. Crucially, StreamForest
delivers this high efficiency without compromising its substantial
superiority in reasoning accuracy over VideoLLM-Online. In stark
contrast, Qwen2-VL, another model that also prioritizes reasoning
accuracy, demonstrated severe performance bottlenecks. Its processing
speed dropped below 1 FPS on a video merely two minutes long, and it
encountered out-of-memory (OOM) errors on a single A100-80G GPU after
processing only 79 frames.

| Method            |   Resolution | FPS   |
|-------------------|--------------|-------|
| Qwen2.5-VL        |          384 | OOM   |
| VideoLLM-Online   |          384 | 12.3  |
| StreamForest (1k) |          384 | 9.9   |

## I Discussions

## I.1 Limitations

Despite the effectiveness of our proposed method, several limitations
remain that warrant further investigation. Our approach can only rely on
computing inter-frame similarity to determine moments when the model
should proactively produce outputs. Specifically, the method identifies
local minima in similarity scores to detect transitions. However, this
technique primarily captures coarse scene changes and often fails to
accurately detect true semantic event boundaries. To address this
limitation, one possible solution is to incorporate a lightweight MLLM
as an auxiliary reminder module. This module could provide semantic-
level guidance to support more precise and context-aware output
decisions. These limitations suggest promising directions for future
work.

## I.2 Broader Impacts

Our proposed method shows strong potential for real-world streaming
video understanding, especially in critical applications like autonomous
driving. With domain-specific fine-tuning, it can be adapted to various
downstream tasks that require continuous visual processing. As shown in
the main text, the model performs well in autonomous driving scenarios,
where accurate and timely perception is crucial for safety and decision-
making. It can efficiently process live video streams while preserving
finegrained perception and long-term contextual memory. This capability
is particularly valuable under limited computational resources, helping
improve the reliability and responsiveness of intelligent systems in
dynamic environments.

However, as with many vision-language models, potential negative social
impacts must also be considered. If deployed without proper safeguards,
models may inherit or amplify biases present in training data, leading
to unreliable behavior. For instance, performance disparities across
different environments or conditions (e.g., weather, lighting, or
geographic location) could affect the robustness of StreamForest. To
mitigate such risks, we should explore techniques for enhancing
interpretability and controllability of streaming video models in safety
contexts.
