## Abstract

Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) excel at understanding videos
incontext, provided they have full access to the video when answering
queries. However, these models face challenges in streaming scenarios
where hour-long videos must be processed online, and questions need
timely responses. In this work, we propose a training-free approach
compatible with standard Video-LLMs, leveraging three key concepts: 1)
LLM-informed selection of visual tokens to identify those that the LLM
has attended to and contributed to its understanding of each short clip.
Our attention-based selection allows us to discard up to ∼ 95% of
unimportant visual tokens with minimal performance loss; 2) Recurrent
processing of past selected tokens to generate temporally coherent
understanding of each processed clip; 3) Caption-based question
answering for lightweight and accurate responses. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on streaming video benchmarks, striking a
balance between efficiency and effectiveness.

## 1 Introduction

Efficient and effective video question answering and understanding are
crucial for deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) as intelligent
assistants in domains requiring continuous visual input comprehension.
This capability is essential for applications such as autonomous
driving, surveillance, healthcare, and entertainment, where dynamic
visual information must be understood in real-time. Current video
understanding research with VLMs [31, 17, 2] typically processes entire
videos in-context, presenting densely sampled frames alongside text
queries to generate responses, with common training approaches focusing
on text generation tasks like video captioning or question answering.
While effective for short clips, this brute-force approach faces
critical limitations with longer videos: computational costs escalate as
visual tokens multiply, and exceeding context length limits forces
sparse sampling that risks information loss. These challenges become
particularly pronounced in streaming scenarios where continuous visual
input renders full-video processing unsustainable. This necessitates
efficient compression techniques that selectively process frames,
condense visual information, and maintain easily retrievable memory
structures for effective query response.

Recent efforts have focused on compressing the information from short
video clips, moving away from the brute-force approach of processing the
entire video in a single pass, and thus extending model capabilities to
handle long video understanding. These approaches include methods that
either compress only the visual information (before the LLM) encoded by
a vision encoder [38, 12, 10], or store only textual descriptions of
short clips [1], and retrieve only those relevant to the input query.
Another line of work involves the LLM in video processing by generating
compressed representations in the form of summarization tokens, like
VideoStreaming [24], or storing KV-cache during inference, like ReKV
[9], effectively combining the two modalities. While all these
approaches mark important progress, they face amplified challenges in
streaming settings, where past frames cannot be revisited and inputs can
span hours. Training-based approaches [24, 38] face extrapolation issues
with arbitrarily lengthy videos, and scaling their training can be
computationally prohibitive or suffer from data scarcity and annotation
issues for long videos. Training-free approaches like ReKV, while
avoiding retraining, rely on storing large KV-caches, which becomes
memory-intensive and introduces potential redundancy in streaming,
ultimately affecting overall performance. Conversely, clip-wise caption-
only methods (e.g., Goldfish [1]) offer efficiency but lack continuity,
making it difficult to track entities and reason across clips, thus
hindering holistic understanding.

Figure 1: Pipeline of rLiVS: (Left): Long videos are broken down into short visual clips which are processed in a streaming fashion. A short clip is pre-pended with selected visual tokens from past clips in the stream to generate a textual description. History is accumulated by selecting a subset of tokens from the short clip based on attention scores. (Right): Given a query on the past video, the accumulated textual descriptions over a long video are compared to the query embedding and the most similar subset is input to the LLM (within the videoLLM) for question-answering.

In this work, we propose an efficient, training-free, and video LLM-
agnostic solution for streaming video question answering. Our approach
processes long videos (offline or online) by splitting them into short
clips and focuses on three key aspects, integrating visual perception
with language understanding for holistic video comprehension: 1)
Compressing video information to avoid redundancy and inefficiencies in
memory usage by selecting a small set of key visual tokens per short
clip, 2) Accessing past selected visual tokens when processing new short
clips, enabling visual information sharing across short clips and
enhancing overall video comprehension, and 3) Performing text-based
retrieval and answering, harnessing LLMs' proven strength in reasoning
over extended contexts (such as multi-clip captions).

Specifically, during the processing of each short clip (i.e., generating
a caption), we draw inspiration from cognitive neuroscience,
particularly the interplay between attention and memory [6]. Given
memory's limited capacity [23, 7], attention is key to selective
encoding [6]. Accordingly, instead of randomly sampling visual tokens,
we retain those that received the highest attention from the LLM,
treating them as a compressed memory trace of the clip. Furthermore,
building on the idea that past experiences shape current attention [6],
we reuse previously selected tokens when processing subsequent clips.
These past tokens are passed forward with new inputs, allowing memory to
guide attention and support context-aware understanding. Inspired by the
brain's recurrent visual processing [15], we implement a simple FIFO
memory: newly selected tokens are prepended, and the oldest are
discarded once the context limit is reached.

Finally, when answering a question about past events in a video stream,
we retrieve the top K captions based on the similarity of the question
to the previously stored captions of short clips. This approach is
motivated by the efficiency of storing captions alone and empirical
evidence suggesting that long video reasoning is more effective with
representative text. This approach enables us to answer questions based
on the stored captions, rather than reprocessing the previous visual
input, which is a common practice in current works [38, 10]. Figure 1
illustrates our method.

Our approach can be applied to any video-LLM pretrained on short clips,
enabling long video understanding without additional training and
maintaining a low memory footprint. We evaluate our method on three
offline and streaming benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance
with significantly lower memory requirements. The simplicity and strong
performance of our design set a robust baseline for online long-video
question answering.

Our contributions are as follows:

- We propose Recurrent LLM-informed Visual Selection (rLiVS), a simple, training-free approach for long video understanding and question answering.
- Our approach is agnostic to the Video-LLM architecture and does not require any external modules.
- We achieve state-of-the-art performance with significantly lower memory requirements.

In the following, we discuss the closely related work in Section 2 and
present our method in Section 3. We evaluate our method and ablate the
design choices in Section 4 and conclude in Section 5.

## 2 Related Work

Video-Language Models: Recent video-language models have achieved strong
performance on shortform video tasks by aligning visual features with
text using pretrained vision-language transformers [30, 16, 19]. These
models typically sample a small number of frames from each video and
encode them into visual tokens using a vision backbone (e.g., ViT),
which are then fed into a language model either directly or via cross-
modal fusion. However, the number of visual tokens grows linearly with
the number of frames and spatial patches-e.g., sampling 32 frames with a
ViT-base backbone (16×16 patch size) yields over 1,000 tokens-making it
prohibitively expensive to process long videos end-to-end [34, 29]. As a
result, these models are limited to short clips (typically under 30
seconds), lack persistent memory, and cannot capture dependencies across
longer temporal horizons without substantial computational and memory
overhead.

Offline long-video understanding: To overcome the limitations of short-
clip models, several offline approaches have been proposed for long
video understanding by introducing mechanisms to compress or summarize
information across time. Some methods focus on compressing only the
visual modality, either by keyframe selection, feature pooling, or
storing tokenized visual memory [32, 34, 28, 10]. Others rely solely on
textual abstraction, converting short clips into natural language
summaries that are later retrieved and composed to answer queries [1].
More recently, hybrid methods like VideoStreaming [24] train auxiliary
models to generate trainable summarization tokens that condense the
content of each clip into a compact representation, which is stored and
retrieved during inference. While effective, these methods often require
significant offline training to align the summarization with downstream
tasks, are tied to specific pretraining pipelines, and typically process
each clip independently-limiting their ability to build hierarchical or
persistent memory across long videos.

Streaming and Memory-Augmented Video Understanding : In contrast to
offline approaches, streaming video understanding aims to process
incoming video frames incrementally, enabling realtime or low-latency
inference over long temporal horizons. Retrieval-augmented methods
maintain external memory stores of past embeddings and retrieve relevant
context on-the-fly based on the current input, avoiding full-sequence
reprocessing [38]. Similarly, MeMViT [35] incorporate visual memory
modules or cross-modal attention over cached tokens to improve temporal
coherence, though they often rely on fixed-length context windows or
soft attention mechanisms, which scale poorly or suffer from memory
drift over time. In the same direction of visual memory, Video-XL [27]
introduces a custom-trained Video-LLM architecture that learns to
compress and retain visual information over time through supervised
training. However, its performance is tightly coupled to the specific
model architecture and the distribution of video lengths and compression
strategies seen during fine-tuning. Recently, ReKV [9] explored
streaming video question answering by storing full decoder key-value
caches and retrieving relevant context either through internal
attention-based mechanisms or external CLIP-based similarity,
demonstrating that retrieval over cached embeddings can be both
effective and efficient. However, many of these methods either treat
memory as a flat buffer or require storing large volumes of raw
activations, limiting scalability and longer-term abstraction. Our work
builds on these insights by introducing a memory consolidation mechanism
that persistently retains and hierarchically abstracts multimodal
context across a stream, enabling scalable and task-adaptive long-term
understanding.

## 3 Method

We aim to develop an efficient method for streaming scenarios. Our
approach uses a short-clip videoLLM as the backbone, which is capable of
multimodal processing of short video clips and generating textual
responses. Specifically, for the general captioning task, the model,
given a sequence of visual tokens (representing the input frames, V )
extracted from a visual encoder (eg. CLIP [25]) and a potential
instruction ("Describe what is happening in the video."), generates a
textual description C , representing the model's understanding of the
short clip. Rather than storing all the information (as in [9]) we aim
to compress the visual information by leveraging the relation with the
textual tokens of each short clip, producing a compressed visual-guided-
by-text representation, S . We further target a model-agnostic design
differently from [11] and [24]). The key aspect here is that we have the
input to the LLM, V , and its corresponding caption, C , which can be
interpreted as the model's understanding expressed in text.

## 3.1 Attention based Visual Token Selection

Several works have explored token selection based on attention weights
[37, 13, 26]. These methods typically involve dropping tokens from early
layers to enhance the efficiency of processing long contexts in later
layers. Evidence from these studies suggests that a model's attention
can serve as a strong indicator of the relevance of visual tokens.

Our goal is to globally select tokens from a short clip after it has
been processed by the VideoLLM, providing context for subsequent clips.
These tokens will guide the LLM's attention in the next short clip to
focus on content that is coherent with past events, thereby reducing
attention to background tokens, noise, and redundant visual tokens.

Short Clip Processing. We employ a pre-trained video-LLM, which consists
of a visual encoder VE, an LLM and a projector module P. Given a T
-frame video clip V and an instruction X I , outputs a textual caption
of the video, C :

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where X V ∈ R TN V × D and N V denotes the number of spatial tokens per
frame, and D is the dimension of the LLM tokens. The target is to select
a sparse set of tokens S ∈ R T × N S × D where N S ≪ N V .

Attention Coefficients Calculation. Let us denote X C the embedding of
the generated caption. By the last generated token, attention
coefficient tensor is estimated between the generated text tokens and
the input tokens. We define the attention matrix A l,h ∈ R ( TN V + N I
+ N C ) × ( TN V + N I + N C ) calculated on X l = [ X l V , X l I , X l
C ] in a given layer l and a given attention head h where N I is the
number of text tokens in the instruction prompt and N C is the number of
tokens in the number of generated caption tokens.

After transferring X l into Key K l,h , Value V l,h and Query Q l,h ,
the attention scores A l,h are computed using the scaled dot-product
attention:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where W l,h Q , W l,h K , W l,h V are the learnable weight matrices for
queries, keys, and values, respectively 1 .

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where d k is the dimension of attention heads.

First we extract the attention coefficients representing the cross
attention between the generated caption and the input visual tokens:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

1 Our method focuses on attention weights, making operations involving
the values V l,h unnecessary and thus discarded.

We then calculate an attention score for each input visual token X V j,
: by averaging the attention scores from all generated caption tokens N
C . Finally, the global importance score for a given visual token X V j,
: is determined by averaging the attention scores across different
attention heads H and layers L , representing the overall attention of
the model.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

In practice, to limit the compute cost, we consider only a subset of
layers. Note that instead of averaging considering other operations such
as max pooling is straight forward.

where π = argsort ( a ) are the indices that sort a in descending order
2 .

## 3.2 Long Video Recurrent Processing.

For the very first short clip X (0) V we have selected a set of N S
tokens S (0) receiving the highest attention from the generated caption.
Now for a next shortclip X (1) V , we provide as input to the LLM the
previously selected tokens S (0) as input along with the full set of
tokens comprising the current video clip X (1) V . Similarly, after
generating a caption C (1) we select a sparse set of most relevant
tokens receiving highest attention scores from X (1) V : S (1) .

For the following video shortclips, we create a FIFO queue of past
selected tokens [ S (0) , S (1) , . . . , S ( t ) ] which are provided
to the LLM as context a long with the next short clip raw tokens X ( t
+1) V up to the limit of the context window length W or compute
constraint.

## 3.3 Efficient Video Question Answering

We have illustrated how to process each video clip tokens X ( t ) V
representing T frames while having access to a long window of past
selected tokens. During this process a caption C ( t ) is generated,
capturing the LLM thoughts and understanding about the current clip
events conditioned on past clips provided in the context window. We
store these generated captions embeddings { X ( t ) C } and given a
question q , we compute the average cosine similarity between the
question tokens X q and the tokens of each stored caption { X ( t ) C }
. Instead of retrieving the top K captions based solely on average
cosine similarity to the query q , we use Maximal Marginal Relevance
(MMR) [4], a common retrieval technique where a score is calculated by
balancing relevance to the query (cosine similarity between caption and
query) with diversity among the selected captions (cosine similarity
between candidate caption and already selected ones). Utilizing this
technique, we effectively reduce potential redundancy that can emerge in

recurrent caption generation, while promoting coverage of distinct
information when answering. Algorithm 1 summarizes our approach.

Our simple design and reliance on generated captions for video question
answering is stemmed from the efficiency of storing the caption tokens
IDs and the utility of similarity estimation between textual tokens
without the reliance on any external embedding encoder such as CLIP
[25]. Although we can store and provide both visual tokens X ( t ) V and
captions X ( t ) C to the LLM for question answering, our experiments
show that video-LLMs perform better with only caption input.

2 Basically, we select the top N S visual tokens (based on the attention
scores), and store them in their original temporal order.

## 4 Experiments

In this section, we evaluate our proposed method against state-of-the-
art approaches in streaming and long video understanding benchmarks,
demonstrating strong performance and notable efficiency across
experiments.

Evaluation Benchmarks. We evaluate our method's effectiveness in online
scenarios using the Realtime VStream-QA benchmark [38], which includes
RVS-Movie (emphasizing plot understanding) and RVS-Ego (focusing on
visual comprehension)-both featuring 40-minute videos with diverse open-
ended questions. To demonstrate robustness, we also report results on
offline benchmarks: MovieChat [28] (170 videos averaging 576 seconds
across various genres with 510 questions testing long-range
comprehension), offline VStream-QA ( VS-Movie and VS-Ego ), and CG-Bench
[5] (1,219 videos averaging 27 minutes with 12K multiple-choice
questions). Additionally, we conduct an ablation on NextQA -valset [36]
(570 shorter videos averaging 44 seconds with 5K multiple-choice
questions) to validate our attention-based visual token selection
approach.

Baselines. We compare our method against established video LLMs and
recent long video understanding approaches. Training-required baselines
include: VideoChatGPT [22] (employing temporal-spatial pooling), Chat-
UniVi [14] (offering unified image/video representations through a set
of dynamic visual tokens), LLaMA-VID [21] (using learning-based
compression with context/content tokens per frame), VideoScan [20]
(compressing frames into single learned semantic tokens preserving
temporal context), and Flash-VStream-7B [38] (processing frame-by-frame
with hierarchical memory including FIFO spatial memory, weighted k-means
temporal consolidation, and past-current information abstraction). All
operate on non-overlapping sliding windows. Training-free baselines
include: MovieChat [28] (using FIFO short-term memory and similarity-
based long-term consolidation), Goldfish [1] (processing independent
short clips with caption generation and retrieval), and ReKV [9]
(storing full KV-Cache retrieved through cross-attention to queries).We
coin our method rLiVS as a short for recurrent LLM-informed Visual
Selection.

Evaluation Metrics. For benchmarks with open-ended questions, we report
both Accuracy and a Score based on GPT-3.5 evaluation, following prior
works (we use gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 , consistent with the evaluation setup
of ReKV [9]). The model is given the question, ground truth, and
prediction, and asked to assess whether the prediction matches the
answer ("Yes/No") and to assign a compatibility score. The prompt
template is provided in the Appendix. For multiple-choice benchmarks, we
compute accuracy by directly comparing predictions to ground truths.
Additionally, for the streaming benchmark, we report end-to-end latency,
GPU usage (from query arrival to response), and KV-Cache utilization.
Benchmarkings are conducted on a single A100 GPU.

Implementation Details. We implement our method on LLaVA-OneVision [17],
a strong VLM for image and video tasks, enabling direct comparison with
ReKV (current state-of-the-art on RVS benchmarks). We demonstrate
versatility by evaluating both 7B and 0.5B variants, with 7B used unless
specified otherwise. Since LLaVA-OV is trained with 32 frames (196
visual tokens each), we allocate 16 frames for current short clips and
16 for short-term recurrent memory. We select only 196 visual tokens
from 3,136 available (16×196), retaining just 6.25% of total visual
information per short clip. Following previous works, we process RVS-
Movie and RVS-Ego at 0.5 FPS [38, 9], MovieChat at 1 FPS, and CG-Bench
and offline VS-Stream at 0.5 FPS, with 10K context tokens for retrieval
and generation. We average attention scores from 4 (of 28) backbone
layers across experiments. To show generalization across video-LLM
backbones of our streaming video pipeline, we also incorporate rLIVS to
Qwen2.5-VL-7B [3] and test on RVS streaming benchmark. We provide
details for this setup in Appendix A. Finally, in the Appendix we
include ablations on layer selection (Appendix B), as well as on
attention aggregation methods (average vs. max), and analysis of how
context length affects performance and latency in Appendices C and D,
respectively.

streaming video understanding.

## 4.1.1 Evaluation of Visual Token Selection Strategies on Short Video Datasets

Visual token selection is central to our method, as it brings past
information into current short-clip processing via recurrency, enhancing
captioning and understanding of the overall video stream.

We argue that naive methods such as uniform sampling or mean pooling
risk discarding important information, while traditional clustering
approaches like K-Means can be slow and suboptimal in high-dimensional
spaces. Instead, by leveraging the LLM's attention-already computed
during caption generation-we gain a powerful, low-overhead signal that
enables aggressive compression with minimal performance loss. To
empirically validate this, we conduct experiments on the NextQA-valset,
a short video benchmark, to assess the token's selection quality
independently from the factors of long video understanding. We compare
the full model's performance while retaining only 6% or 12% of visual
tokens-selected with different methods:

Table 2: Accuracy (Acc.) of different selection methods evaluated on
NextQA-valset.

| Selection Method         |   Next-QA (valset) Acc. |
|--------------------------|-------------------------|
| Full Model               |                    78.6 |
| Uniform Sampling ( 6% )  |                    75.5 |
| Mean Pooling ( 6% )      |                    70.7 |
| K-Means ( 6% )           |                    76.8 |
| Attention (ours) ( 6% )  |                    77.0 |
| Uniform Sampling ( 12% ) |                    76.7 |
| Mean Pooling ( 12% )     |                    75.5 |
| K-Means ( 12% )          |                    78.1 |
| Attention (ours) ( 12% ) |                    78.4 |

1) via uniform sampling, 2) via mean pooling, 3) via K-Means and 4)
based on our attention selection mechanism to the generated caption, as
described in Section 3.1. Table 2 confirms our intuition; while uniform
sampling results in 2-3% performance loss, our attention-based selection
outperforms uniform sampling even at twice the compression rate-
incurring only a 1.5% performance drop with 6% of visual tokens, and
nearly matching full-model performance at 12%. Moreover, mean pooling,
naively combining visual tokens without considering their relevance,
yields the worst performance, while K-Means performs comparably to
attention-based selection but it is significantly slower-especially when
operating in the high-dimensional input space of the LLM-introducing
unnecessary computational overhead.

## 4.1.2 Offline Video Question Answering Datasets

In Table 1 we present results on offline long video understanding
benchmarks. rLiVS incorporated in LLaVA-OV-7B achieves state-of-the-art
performance in VS-Ego and VS-Movie benchmarks, outperforming the
previous best by 2% and 3%, respectively. On MovieChat and CG-Bench, our
method achieves strong results, outperforming prior approaches,
demonstrating the effectiveness of heavily compressing visual tokens
without harming performance. Overall, these results indicate that our
method serves as a strong baseline, efficiently handling long inputs,
requiring no additional training or fine-tuning-while maintaining
minimal memory storage requirements.

## 4.1.3 Streaming Video Question Answering Datasets

Finally, we present our results on RVS-Ego and RVS-Movie, long video
streaming benchmarks that represent the primary focus of this work and
the main setting for evaluating our proposed method. rLiVS demonstrates
strong suitability for this setting as shown in Table 3, outperforming
the previous best, ReKV, with the same backbone model, by 2-3% and
achieving new state-of-the-art results on the benchmark, while also
being nearly 1 second faster than ReKV . Importantly, our attention-
based compression technique-combined with recurrency and caption-guided
retrieval and answering-proves robust across both subsets of the
streaming benchmark. Unlike ReKV, rLiVS does not require external memory
offloading and operates within a 10K context window, enabling both
efficient and effective performance, while resulting in 11GB less peak
VRAM usage with the same video-LLM backbone. Interestingly, when paired
with the lightweight 0.5B model, our method outperforms the previous
second-best approach that uses a 7B model, as well as ReKV with the same
0.5B model by 2.9% on RVS-Ego and 6.7% on RVS-Movie, highlighting the
strength of caption-based answering even in smaller model variants
emphasizing the efficient aspect of our design choices. Finally, by
coupling our method with the recent strong multimodal LLM Qwen2.5-VL, we
further improve performance on RVS-Ego, reaching 68.1% accuracy. This
highlights the model-agnostic and plug-and-play nature of our porposed
rLiVS .

A key strength of our framework is its ability to adapt token selection
dynamically based on task instructions, which serve as top-down signals.
Through instruction-guided attention, the model selects a sparse subset
of semantically relevant visual tokens, enabling efficient, context-
aware understanding. As shown in Appendix H, token selection is highly
sensitive to the instruction, with different tasks yielding distinct
attention patterns. This adaptivity supports a broad range of video
understanding tasks without retraining or architectural changes,
highlighting promising directions for scalable and generalizable long
video models.

## 4.1.4 Ablation of rLiVS Design Choices

Next, we ablate our method's core design choices through targeted
experiments, demonstrating the following: (1) the importance of
recurrency when processing long videos split in short clips; (2) the
superiority of captions over selected visual tokens-or their
combination-for retrieval and answering in long video streams, (3) the
performance benefits of LLM- Table 4: Ablation on the effect of
accessing past visual information via recurrency and attention
selection.

| Method         | RVS-Ego   | RVS-Ego   | RVS-Movie   | RVS-Movie   | MovieChat   | MovieChat   |
|----------------|-----------|-----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
|                | Acc.      | Sco.      | Acc.        | Sco.        | Acc.        | Sco.        |
| rLiVS          | 65.3      | 4.0       | 57.7        | 3.6         | 78.0        | 4.0         |

informed attention-based selection compared to naive uniform sampling in
streaming scenarios; and (4) the effect of compression rate on
downstream performance.

The importance of recurrency in long streams. As previously discussed,
[1] proposes processing long videos as independent short clips, storing
only the textual outputs (captions) generated by a video-LLM and
retrieving relevant information based on cosine similarity to the input
question. While this approach is simple and efficient, it suffers from a
lack of continuity that becomes increasingly problematic as video length
increases. Specifically, the absence of shared visual information across
clips and sole reliance on textual representations can hinder the
model's ability to consistently track entities-such as people or
objects-across time, especially when captions lack distinguishing
context. These limitations naturally impact performance. To empirically
prove this, we present results (Table 4) on RVS-Ego, RVS-Movie, and
MovieChat, showing that introducing recurrency consistently improves
performance by 3-4%, under otherwise identical conditions. Importantly,
recurrency in our method serves a dual purpose: (1) it enhances
continuity and coherence across short clips, boosting long video
understanding, and (2) it guides the LLM's attention during visual token
selection, reinforcing its own impact.

Captions vs Visual Tokens for retrieval and answering . A natural
question is whether textual information (captions) or selected visual
tokens provide a better signal for retrieving and answering user
queries-that is, which representation is the best choice for effectively
preserving crucial information while enabling compression. For retrieval
, the input query is embedded into the LLM's input space. Visual tokens,
projected ad hoc from the visual encoder, lack learned semantic
alignment with queries, leading to less meaningful similarity scores (as
illustrated in Appendix F). Proper similarity between them would require
projecting both queries and visual tokens into a common space (like CLIP
encoders [25]), adding extra computational steps to our pipeline.

In contrast, captions share the same modality as queries and can be
directly embedded to the LLM's input space, making them naturally better
suited for retrieval via simple cosine similarity. For answering , Table
5 presents results using visual tokens, captions, or their combination
as retrieved information for each short clip. Among the approaches,
using only captions achieves the best performance. Despite visual tokens
theoretically offering richer information, they under-perform likely due
to the

Table 5: Comparison of vision vs. language modalities for information retrieval and query response on RVSEgo/Movie benchmarks.

| Retrieved Modality     | RVS-Ego   | RVS-Ego   | RVS-Movie   | RVS-Movie   |
|------------------------|-----------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
|                        | Acc.      | Sco.      | Acc.        | Sco.        |
| Selected Visual Tokens | 58.2      | 3.9       | 48.4        | 3.5         |
| Captions               | 65.1      | 4.0       | 57.7        | 3.6         |
| Combination            | 63.0      | 4.0       | 54.3        | 3.5         |

mismatch between video-LLM training data (predominantly short clips of a
few seconds) and evaluation contexts (minutes/hour steaming videos).
Current video-LLMs struggle to comprehend visual information at larger
timescales, even when computationally representable as input. This
aligns with findings from [33], which demonstrated that despite the
existence of architectural optimizations that enable long video
processing (through memory structures or compressed representations),
video-LLMs still demonstrate significant performance degradation in
these contexts. In contrast, LLM research has extensively explored long-
context adaptation, developing effective modeling and training
techniques that enable reasoning over extended sequences of textual
inputs, such as multi-clip captions. Thus by utilizing only the captions
as past information during retrieval and answering, we effectively
transform the problem into a text-based long context QA problem,
harnessing LLMs' proven strength in reasoning over these extended
contexts.

Attention-based vs Uniform Visual Selection on streaming scenarios. We
previously demonstrated (Sec. 4.1.1) that our attentionbased selection
outperforms uniform sampling in short video QA, even at twice the
compression rate, enabling aggressive token reduction with minimal
performance loss. We now extend this evaluation to the streaming
setting, where selection drives captioning (through recurrency)

Table 6: Comparison of selection methods within our pipeline on RVS-Ego and RVS-Movie.

| Selection Method   | RVS-Ego   | RVS-Ego   | RVS-Movie   | RVS-Movie   |
|--------------------|-----------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
|                    | Acc.      | Sco.      | Acc.        | Sco.        |
| Uniform Sampling   | 64.2      | 3.9       | 56.0        | 3.5         |
| Attention (ours)   | 65.1      | 4.0       | 57.7        | 3.6         |

and thus plays a critical role in overall performance. Our results in
Table 6 are consistent with those in the short clip benchmark:
attention-based selection, leveraging LLM's ability to attend to crucial
information, effectively filtering out noise and redundancy, is superior
in both subsets by 1-2%, without introducing any additional overhead,
since caption generation is part of our pipeline. Note that uniform
sampling is integrated into our full pipeline, replacing only the
selection strategy. This approach serves as a significantly stronger
baseline compared to the uniform sampling baseline of ReKV [9], as
demonstrated in the Appendix.

## Compression Rate and Downstream Performance.

Our choice of aggressive visual token compression (e.g., retaining only
6%) may raise concerns about potential information loss and downstream
performance degradation. However, this reflects a practical trade-off in
real-time video understanding. Long-form videos often contain
substantial visual redundancy, allowing for effective token filtering
without harming performance. To validate this, Table 7 shows how
accuracy varies with different compression rates on the NextQA
validation set. Retaining 12% of visual tokens nearly matches full
performance, while 6% leads to negligible loss 3 . Our framework remains
flexible, with the compression ratio tunable to task requirements.

Table 7: Acc. on NextQA valset for different % of visual tokens selected
with our proposed attention-based method.

| Selected Tokens   |   Acc.(%) |
|-------------------|-----------|
| 1%                |      68.0 |
| 6%                |      77.0 |
| 12%               |      78.4 |
| 19%               |      78.7 |
| 25%               |      79.0 |
| 100%              |      78.6 |

Looking ahead, adaptive compression-dynamically adjusting retention
based on visual content complexity-is a promising direction. While it
may improve performance in visually rich scenes, it introduces
computational overhead, which we currently avoid to maintain online
efficiency. Qualitative results in Appendix J further demonstrate the
robustness of our method under extreme compression.

## 5 Discussion

Streaming video question answering and understanding is an emerging
landscape that can enable the reliable deployment of intelligent agents
in various domains requiring visual comprehension. A key design
requirement for practical solutions is low memory and compute usage. In
this work, we propose a simple approach based on two design choices:
first, the instant selection of visual tokens based on the LLM's
attention, resulting in ∼ 95% compression rate of short clip content;
second, the use of recurrent processing and caption based question
answering to smoothly enable higher-level reasoning over longer time
spans. With these components, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on
streaming video benchmarks. Our approach is agnostic to the video-LLM
deployed and requires no training, setting a strong baseline for future
work.

Beyond question answering, our framework shows potential as a general-
purpose backbone for long-form video processing and understanding tasks
such as summarization, retrieval, and object tracking. Preliminary
results on long video summarization (Appendix I) provide initial
evidence of the method's generalizability. Additionally, our analysis in
Appendix H demonstrates that the memory selection mechanism is both
task-sensitive and instruction-conditioned, underscoring its flexibility
and adaptability. We view this as a promising direction for future
research, where natural language task descriptions can dynamically guide
memory selection and reasoning.

Limitations. Despite strong performance, our method prioritizes
efficiency over completeness by attending only to selected content
during short clip processing. This may overlook fine-grained details and
harm continuity, as the LLM lacks access to the full video history.
While our FIFO memory buffer offers short-term context and captions
serve as long-term memory, this temporal mechanism may not always
capture semantically salient information. A promising direction is to
explore more semantic, rather than purely temporal, memory selection
strategies that remain efficient.

Our approach is also training-free and fully reliant on pre-trained
backbones, inheriting their limitations in visual understanding and
temporal reasoning. The recurrent captioning process, conditioned on
prior frames and instructions, can introduce redundancy across captions,
which may affect retrieval performance. We partially address this by
considering both novelty and relevance during retrieval. Future work
includes integrating the method into training pipelines and evaluating
across a wider range of models and benchmarks to better understand its
strengths and limitations.

3 An additional benefit is that selecting only 6% of tokens allows more
memory slots in the FIFO queue, enhancing long-term understanding.

## Technical Appendices and Supplementary Material

## A Experimental Details

In this section, we provide a detailed description of our evaluation
setup and methodological choices to ensure the reproducibility of our
experiments:

- Visual Tokens Selection : As described in the main paper, our attention-based selection method selects k out of N visual tokens globally. The backbone video-LLM we use (LLaVA-OV) is trained on 32 video frames, each contributing 196 tokens, resulting in a total of 6,272 visual tokens. We split the 6,272-token context window into two halves: the first is used to encode past information (by injecting previously selected visual tokens), and the second is reserved for the raw visual tokens of the current short clip. We choose k such that it evenly divides the 3,136 tokens of the second half (current short clip) in order to fully utilize the context. During selection, we consider only on the second half, corresponding to the current short clip (i.e., 3,136 tokens). For both long-video offline and streaming benchmarks, we select 196 tokens from this set, which is 1 16 (or approximately 6 . 25% ) of the total. For simplicity, we report this as 6% s throughout the paper. In our uniform baseline, everything remains the same and we just sample 196 out of the 3,136 tokens of the current short clip.
- Resources : Across all experiments, we utilize one or two NVIDIA A100 GPUs with 40GB of memory. Latency and VRAM measurements are conducted on a single GPU.
- LLM Evaluation : As reported in the main paper, we follow prior work [9, 38] for LLMbased evaluation and use gpt-3.5-turbo . The prompt templates employed are provided in Section K.
- Qwen2.5-VL setup : This model dynamically embeds frames based on input resolution, resulting in different number of tokens per frame. In our experiments, we use the same number of tokens per short clip as LLaVA-OV to ensure fair comparison.

## B Layer Selection for Attention-Based Visual Token Selection

In our method, visual tokens are selected based on their attention
scores to the generated captions. Rather than using attention from all
layers, we compute scores from a small subset. Modern fast attention
implementations (e.g., FlashAttention-2 [8]) avoid explicitly
materializing the full N 2 attention matrix (with N as the sequence
length) to reduce memory and computational cost. To maintain efficiency
and avoid additional overhead, we use attention from only a small ℓ out
of L total number of layers (28 in LLaVA-OV). In the main paper
experiments, we set l = 4 and we select these layers via uniform
sampling across the depth of the network. As shown in Table 8, this
simple strategy provides robust performance comparable to using all
layers, with minimal variance. In contrast, selecting layers from
localized regions (e.g., early, middle, or late) yields less stable
results, and using a single layer results in significantly worse
performance.

## C Methods for Aggregating Attention Scores in Token Selection

In our method, we opted for average score over different attention heads
for token selection; however, we noted that alternative score
aggregation strategies could also be explored. Here we present results
on the NextQA-valset using max as the aggregation method and selecting
6% of the visual tokens (to directly compare with the results of the
main paper). As shown in Table 9, both methods perform similarly, with a
negligible difference of only 0 . 1% in accuracy.

## D Context Length for Retrieving &amp; Answering

In the main paper, we use a context length of 10k tokens for retrieving
and answering user queries. This choice is motivated by two key factors:
(1) Latency : In streaming video applications, where user queries arrive
alongside frames in real-time, low-latency responses are critical.
Increasing the context length substantially slows down both retrieval
and LLM inference. (2) Noise Filtering : Long video streams are highly
redundant, and larger contexts increase the risk of including irrelevant
information, which can degrade performance. We empirically validate
these considerations in Table 10 on RVSMovie and RVS-Ego streaming
benchmarks, showing that while increasing context from 6k to 10k
improves accuracy, a further increase to 20k offers no additional
benefit-and in some cases, even hurts performance-while incurring higher
computational costs. Overall, a 10k context length offers a favorable
trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency. Finally, we note that
ReKV [9] retrieves 64 frames (each consisting of 196 tokens, since the
same model is used), resulting in a larger context and, thus, in higher
latency (2.7s) as reported in the main paper.

4 These layers are used across experiments in the main paper.

## E Positional Information

A potential concern with our proposed method is the manipulation or loss
of spatial positional information during visual token selection. In
rLiVS, we retain only the temporal order of selected tokens, potentially
altering their original spatial layout when reinserting them into the
LLM context. However, our initial experiments suggest that this design
choice does not hinder performance. As shown in Table 7, selecting only
19% of the visual tokens-based on our relevance scoring and preserving
temporal order-achieves comparable performance to using the full set of
visual tokens on the NextQA validation set. Interestingly, selecting 25%
of tokens even outperforms the full-token baseline, indicating that
reducing redundancy and filtering out less informative content is more
beneficial than strictly preserving spatial structure. This finding
aligns with prior observations (e.g.,

[13]) that video data contains substantial redundancy, which can degrade
performance if not mitigated. Additionally, since vision-language models
(VLMs) are primarily pre-trained for caption generation, we posit that
leveraging this objective as an intermediate step acts as an effective
noise filter. During pretraining, these models learn to focus on the
most informative visual tokens-those that align with the semantics of
captions. Our method builds directly on this property by selecting
tokens that contribute most to caption generation, thereby enhancing
relevance and reducing noise. Finally, we note that by choosing not to
address the challenge of accurately injecting positional information,
our method remains orthogonal to any specific video-LLM architecture.
Developing improved strategies to explicitly retain or reintroduce
spatial information-and thereby better model spatio-temporal dynamics
during processing-remains an open research direction, which we leave for
future work.

## F Visual tokens vs Captions based Retrieval

In our ablation studies, we argue that visual tokens projected ad hoc
from the visual encoder lack learned semantic alignment with user
questions. As a result, they produce uninformative similarity scores and
lead to confusing retrieval behavior. In contrast, captions-being in the
same modality as user queries-naturally lie within the same LLM input
space, making them more suitable for retrieval. Figure 2 illustrates the
distribution of cosine similarity scores between visual tokens and
queries, as well as between captions and queries, aggregated across
videos and questions in RVS-Movie. We observe that the similarity
distribution between visual tokens and queries is narrowly centered
around zero, with values ranging from approximately 0 . 02 to 0 . 06 .
In contrast, the similarity scores between captions and queries span a
much broader range-from about 0 . 4 to 0 . 9 -nearly an order of
magnitude wider-potentially indicating a greater capacity to distinguish
relevant from irrelevant content during retrieval.

To verify this point, we present performance results on both RVS-Ego and
RVS-Movie using three similarity-based retrieval methods: visual tokens,
captions, and random selection 5 . As shown in Table 11, retrieval using
visual tokens performs on par with random selection, reinforcing the
claim that visual tokens provide limited value. In contrast, caption-
based retrieval consistently yields improvements of approximately 2-3%,
underscoring its effectiveness.

## G Our uniform baseline vs ReKV's [9]

In the main paper, we compared attention-based and uniform visual token
selection on the streaming benchmarks RVS-Ego and RVS-Movie, showing
that our attention-based method consistently outperforms uniform
sampling by approximately 1-2%. Notably, the uniform baseline in that
comparison was strengthened with two key components of our approach:
recurrency and short-clip level token selection-both of which
significantly improve performance. Here, we present a simpler uniform
sampling baseline more aligned with the setting of [9], where tokens are
sampled uniformly across the entire video. To adapt this to our
framework, we uniformly select 32 frames globally to fill the context,
consistent with the frame length that our video-LLM backbone was
trained. As shown in Table 12, this naive baseline performs
significantly worse-about 10% lower-than our strengthened uniform
variant, highlighting the importance of our proposed design choices.

5 Across methods, captions are retrieved for answering.

## H Attention-based Selection based on Input Instruction

## H.1 Core Mechanism

We propose a flexible top-down attention mechanism in which input
instructions guide the selection of visual tokens through a caption- or
response-generation step. The overall pipeline is structured as follows:

Instruction → Generated Caption/Response → Attention-Based Token
Selection

Tokens are selected based on their attention scores during text
generation, aligning with task-specific semantic relevance. As
discussed, this mechanism draws inspiration from human memory systems,
wherein attention is modulated by task-driven goals rather than uniform
processing across all inputs.

While prior work has leveraged attention scores for token reduction [13,
26, 37], these approaches typically operate within individual layers,
pruning tokens based on localized attention during early processing
stages. In contrast, our method introduces several key innovations.
First, we compute cross-layer attention aggregation , identifying tokens
that receive consistently high attention across multiple layers. Second,
we apply sparse token retention , keeping only a small subset of visual
tokens (approximately 6%) based on the aggregated scores. Third, through
recurrent token reuse , the selected tokens are propagated across
successive short video segments, enabling temporal continuity without
any model fine-tuning. This design not only reduces computational cost
but also preserves semantic coherence across clips, facilitating
efficient and context-aware video reasoning.

## H.2 Task Adaptability

Although our main experiments focus on caption-guided token selection
for visual question answering (VQA), the proposed framework is
inherently instruction-adaptive and capable of generalizing across a
variety of video understanding tasks through modification of the input
instruction. For example:

- Person Tracking : 'Track the movement of the person in the red shirt throughout this video sequence.'

- Action Recognition : 'Identify and describe the specific athletic movements performed.'
- Object Detection : 'Locate and describe all vehicles appearing in this scene.'

Each task-specific instruction elicits distinct model outputs, leading
to unique attention patterns and token selections that reflect the
semantic priorities of the task. To qualitatively assess this behavior,
we conducted a comparative analysis of token selection overlaps under
varying instructions.

Case Study: Instruction Sensitivity We selected two representative
videos and evaluated the overlap of selected visual tokens using a
generic captioning prompt versus task-specific instructions:

- Video 1 : A girl with sunglasses is the main foreground object.
- -Instruction : 'Track the locations of the girl wearing the sunglasses in the video.'
- -Token Overlap with Generic Prompt : 44%
- Video 2 : Two people playing cards, with interest focused on the background.
- -Instruction : 'Locate and describe the objects appearing in the background of the video.'
- -Token Overlap with Generic Prompt : 8%

The generic prompt used in both cases was: 'Describe what's happening in
the video,' consistent with the one used during main captioning
experiments. The results demonstrate that token selection is highly
sensitive to the given instruction, validating the dynamic adaptability
of our attention-based mechanism.

## I Long Video Summarization Task

In this section, we conduct a preliminary evaluation of our method's
task generalizability through long video summarization. Using the MLVU
validation split [39], we compute the holistic video summarization score
and compare our approach to Video-XL [27], a recent training-based
streaming video understanding model that also employs recurrent
mechanisms. As shown in Table 13, rLiVS outperforms Video-XL in holistic
summarization quality.

Table 13: Holistic video summarization scores on MLVU (validation).

| Method       | Model Size   |   MLVU Summarization Score |
|--------------|--------------|----------------------------|
| Video-XL     | 7B           |                       3.40 |
| rLiVS (Ours) | 7B           |                       3.65 |

These results demonstrate that rLiVS not only matches but outperforms
specialized, trained architectures like Video-XL while remaining
training-free and easily extensible. We include a more detailed
breakdown of this comparison in the revised version of the paper.

## J Qualitative Analysis

To assess the effectiveness of our aggressive token compression in
complex and dynamic scenarios, we conducted a qualitative evaluation on
a subset of videos from the SportsQA dataset [18]. Although full
quantitative results are pending due to dataset access constraints, we
compare caption outputs generated using our method (6% token retention)
against those generated using all visual tokens.

Despite the significant reduction in token count, the model retains its
ability to produce semantically rich, fine-grained descriptions, closely
matching the full-token baseline. Below are selected examples from the
aerobic gymnastics category:

- Full : 'The video showcases a synchronized gymnastics routine performed by a group of athletes at the 10th European Championships for Aerobic Gymnastics.'
- 6% : 'The video is about a gymnastics routine performed by the Italian team at the 10th European Championships.'

- Full : 'The video showcases a rhythmic gymnastics performance by three athletes.' 6% : 'The video showcases a rhythmic gymnastics routine performed by three athletes.'
- Full : 'The video showcases a synchronized gymnastics routine performed by two athletes at the 5th Aerobic Gymnastics Asian Championships.'
- 6% : 'The video is about two gymnasts performing a synchronized routine at the 5th Aerobic Gymnastics Asian Championships.'
- Full : 'The video is about a rhythmic gymnastics performance by two athletes at the 7th FIG Aerobics World Age Group Competitions in Incheon, Korea.' 6% : 'The video showcases a rhythmic gymnastics routine performed by two athletes.'

These examples indicate that our model maintains high semantic fidelity,
even under aggressive compression, and generalizes well to fast-changing
scenes with multiple actors and fine-grained actions. This suggests the
viability of our fixed but efficient token selection approach in
highcomplexity domains such as sports.

## K Prompt Templates

We show here the prompts we use for caption generation and for the LLM
evaluation:

Caption Generation. "Describe what's happening in the video."

LLMevaluation. For this, we follow previous works [38, 9] and utilize
the following commonly used template:

```
messages=[ { "role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent chatbot designed for evaluating the correctness of generative outputs for question-answer pairs. " "Your task is to compare the predicted answer with the correct answer and determine if they match meaningfully. Here's how you can accomplish the task:" "---" "##INSTRUCTIONS: " "-Focus on the meaningful match between the predicted answer and the correct answer.\n" "-Consider synonyms or paraphrases as valid matches.\n" "-Evaluate the correctness of the prediction compared to the answer." }, { "role": "user", "content": "Please evaluate the following video-based question-answer pair:\n\n" f"Question: {question}\n" f"Correct Answer: {answer}\n" f"Predicted Answer: {pred}\n\n" "Provide your evaluation only as a yes/no and score where the score is an integer value between 0 and 5, with 5 indicating the highest meaningful match. " "Please generate the response in the form of a Python dictionary string with keys 'pred' and 'score', where value of 'pred' is a string of 'yes' or 'no' and value of 'score' is in INTEGER, not STRING." "DO NOT PROVIDE ANY OTHER OUTPUT TEXT OR EXPLANATION. Only provide the Python dictionary string. " "For example, your response should look like this: {'pred': 'yes', 'score': 4.8}." } ]
```

## L Broader Impact

The broader impact of our approach can be discussed from three main
aspects: the environmental impact, accessibility, and ethical
consideration. Our method significantly reduces computational costs and
energy consumption, subsequently lowering the carbon footprint
associated with long video understanding. Along with the efficiency, our
approach makes streaming video question answering readily accessible to
practitioners and researchers with limited resources. However, as in the
case of most AI research, our approach can potentially be misused, and
it is crucial to ensure a responsible application. As such, preventing
its use in unauthorized surveillance or privacy violations is important.
In general, developing comprehensive guidelines and regulations on the
ethical use of large video language models is essential to mitigate
these risks.
